<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>When in 1899 I published the "Bristol Royal
Mail," I scarcely supposed that it would
be practicable to gather further historical facts
of local interest sufficient to admit of the compilation
of a companion book to that work. Such, however, has
been the case, and much additional information has
been procured as regards the Mail Services of the District.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, that is not surprising as
Bristol is a very ancient city, and was once the
second place of importance in the kingdom, with
necessary constant mail communication with
London, the seat of Government.</p>

<p>I am, therefore, enabled to introduce to notice
"The King's Post," with the hope that it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
prove interesting and find public support equal
to that generously afforded to its forerunner,
which treated of Mail and Post Office topics from
earliest times.</p>

<p>I have been rendered very material assistance
in my researches by Mr. J.A. Housden, late of
the Savings Bank Department, G.P.O., London;
also by Mr. L.C. Kerans, ex-postmaster of Bath,
and Messrs. S.I. Toleman and G.E. Chambers,
ex-assistant Superintendents of the Bristol Post
Office.</p>

<p>I have gathered many interesting facts from
"Stage Coach and Mail," by Mr. C.G. Harper, to
whom I express hearty indebtedness; and I am
also under deep obligation to Mr. Edward Bennett,
Editor of the "St. Martin's-le-Grand Magazine,"
and the Assistant Editor, Mr. Hatswell, for much
valuable assistance.</p>

<p>The difficulty in Queen Elizabeth's time of
communicating with persons at a distance
from Bristol before the establishment of a post
office is illustrated by the following item from
the City Chamberlain's accounts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1580, August. Paid to Savage, the foot post,
to go to Wellington with a letter to the Recorder
touching the holding of the Sessions, and if not
there to go to Wimborne Minster, where he has
a house, where he found him, and returned with
a letter; which post was six days upon that
journey in very foul weather, and I paid him for
his pains 13s. 4d."</p>

work in Bristol is that of 1615, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
City Chamberlain paid a tradesman 12s. "for
cloth to make Packer, the foot post, a coat." In
1616, Packer was sent by the same official to
Brewham to collect rents, and was paid 3s. 8d.
for a journey, out and home, of 60 miles. This
system of a foot post to collect money in King
James the First's reign appears to be an early
application of the somewhat analogous plan, which
of recent years has been under departmental consideration
as "C.O.D.," or collection of business and trade charges
by the postman on delivery of parcels&mdash;an exemplification
of there being nothing new under the sun!</p>

<p>That travelling and the conveyance of letters
was difficult in 1626 is evident from the fact that
nearly &pound;60 was spent in setting up wooden posts
along the highway and causeway at Kingswood,
for the guidance of travellers, the tracks being
then unenclosed, so that the "foot post" must
have had no enviable task on his journeys. In
October, 1637, John Freeman was appointed
"thorough post" at Bristol, and ordered to provide
horses for all men riding post on the King's
affairs of King Charles I: Letters were not to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
detained more than half a quarter of an hour, and
the carriers were to run seven miles an hour in
summer, and five in winter. A Government
"running post" from London to Bristol and
other towns was ordered on July 31st, 1638.
No messengers were thenceforth to run to and
from Bristol except those appointed by Thomas
Withering, but letters were allowed to be sent by
common carriers, or by private messengers passing
between friends. The postage was fixed at twopence
for under 80 miles, and at fourpence for
under 140 miles.</p>

<p>In 1644 Lord Hopton "commanded" the
grant of the freedom of Bristol to one Richard
Allen, "Postmaster-General." In August, 1643,
Lord Hopton was appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of Bristol, and held that appointment until 1645,
when Fairfax took the city. Probably Allen was
Postmaster-General of Bristol, and his authority
may have extended to other parts of the country
that were held by the King's forces. Prideaux
was appointed Master of the Posts by Parliament,
and his jurisdiction extended as far as the country
was under the control of Parliament, as distinguished
from such parts of England as adhered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to the King. In 1644, however, very few places&mdash;Bristol
was one of them&mdash;still adhered to Charles.
At an earlier stage of the civil war special posts
had been arranged for the King's service, and it is
thought Bristol was one of the places to which
these special posts were arranged.</p>

<p>In the Calendar of State Papers, under the
year 1660, there is a complaint against one "Teig,"
an anabaptist Postmaster of Bristol, who broke
open letters directed to the King's friends.</p>

<p>The complaint against him appears to have
been very seriously considered by the authorities,
and it induced his friends to take up the cudgels
in his behalf as indicated by the following memorials:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the Hon. John Weaver, Esq.: of the
Council of State: Honoured Sir&mdash;Having so fit a

<p>Having regard to the looseness of the spelling
at that period, it is he, no doubt, who is mentioned
later on as the "Mr. Teague" at the Dolphin, to
whose care a Mr. Browne's letter was addressed
in 1671. If Teig or Teague did continue at his
post until 1671 he must have renounced his
Anabaptist opinions and conformed, for no Postmaster
was to remain in the service unless he was
conformable to the discipline of the Church of
England.</p>

<p>Evans mentions in his Chronological History,
under 1663, a letter addressed: "To Mr. John
Hellier, at his house in Corn Street, in Bristol
Citty," from which it may be inferred that a
postman was then employed for deliveries in the
principal streets.</p>

<p>In the Broadmead Chapel Records (1648-1687),
published in 1847, and now in the Baptist College,
there is mention, at page 126, of a letter of Mr.
Robert Browne, "To my much revered brother,

with Mr. Mitchell, near the Post Office." The
letter was dated Worcester, 15 d. 1 m. 1670-1,
and signed Robert Browne, with this foot-note,
"I am forced to send now by way of London."
A second letter of Mr. Browne, sent in April, 1671,
is mentioned likewise. It is addressed "To my
respected friend Mr. Terrill, at his house in Bristol.
To be left with Mr. Teague at the Dolphin, in
Bristol," and begins "My dear Brother, I hope
you have receeived both mine, that one sent by the

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE POST HOUSE AT THE DOLPHIN INN, IN DOLPHIN STREET,
BRISTOL, 1662.&mdash;EXCHANGE AVENUE AND SMALL STREET
POST OFFICES, BRISTOL.</p></div>


<p>That a Bristol Post-house existed early in the
reign of King Charles II. is indicated by a
letter preserved at the Bristol Museum Library,
which was sent in August of 1662 from Oxford,
and is addressed: "This to be left at the Post-house
in Bristol for my honoured landlord,
Thomas Gore, Esquire, living at Barrow in
Somerset. Post paid to London."</p>

<p>The Dolphin Inn was for several years&mdash;even
down to 1700&mdash;the Bristol Post-house, and it was
there that the postboys stabled their horses.
The inn long afterwards gave its name to Dolphin
Street, which the street still retains. It is believed
the inn stood near the low buildings with large
gateway, in Dolphin Street, shown in the illustration.
These premises at the time the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
was drawn, in about 1815, had become the stables
of the Bush Inn in Corn Street, long celebrated as
Bristol's most famous coaching inn. The site has,
until quite recently, been used in connection with
the carrying business.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BRISTOL POST OFFICE, 1750-1868.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1700 the first actual Post Office was built.
It was erected in All Saints' Lane, and was held
by one Henry Pine, as Postmaster. This Post
Office served the city's purpose until 1742, when
the site was required in connection with the building
of the Exchange, and the Post Office was
transferred to Small Street. In September of
that year (1742), an advertisement describes the
best boarding school for boys in Bristol as being
kept in Small Street by Mr. John Jones, in rooms
"over the Post-house." What kind of building
this was is uncertain, as there is no picture of it
obtainable. Indeed, the first traceable illustration
of a Bristol Post Office is the engraving, a
copy of which is here reproduced, depicting the
building erected in 1750, at the corner of the
Exchange Avenue as it appeared in 1805, when
it was described as "a handsome freestone building,
situated on the west side of the Exchange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to which it forms a side wing, projecting some
feet forward in the street; on the east side being
another building answerable thereto." These
premises served as the Post Office for the long
period of 118 years.</p>

<p>The first half of the present Bristol Post Office
premises in Small Street was occupied by Messrs.
Freeman and Brass and Copper Company.</p>

<p>As a matter of history, a copy of the abstract
of conveyance may, perhaps, be fittingly introduced.
It sets forth the particulars of the uses
to which the site was originally put before taken
by the Post Office.</p>

<p>"21st December, 1865.&mdash;By Indenture between

by an edging of blue color which said
plot of ground formed the site of certain premises
also then recently pulled down which said premises
were in certain Deeds dated 13th February 1861
described as "All that messuage or dwelling-house

Rich then of George Smith as Tenants to Messrs.

the South part and extending from said Street
called Small Street on the East part backward

the said Copper Company the Wall between the
Warehouse and said messuage."</p>

<p>When, in the year 1867, the plan for this new
Post Office building in Small Street had been
prepared and Treasury authority obtained for
the expenditure of a sum of &pound;8,000 in the erection
of the building, the Inland Revenue Department
asked for accommodation in the structure, and
it was arranged that its staff should be lodged on
the first floor of the new building. The building
itself had, therefore, to be carried to a greater
height than had originally been contemplated.
This alteration cost &pound;3,000. There is still evidence
in the building of the occupation of the Inland
Revenue staff, iron gates and spiked barriers in
the first floor passage to cut off their rooms from
the Post Office section still remaining.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Post Office accepted
tenders in September, 1887, for the demolition of
certain premises known as "New Buildings" and
for the erection thereon of additional premises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for the accommodation of the growing Postal
staff. The work began on the 26th September.
The cost of the new wing was estimated at
&pound;16,000. Beneath the superstructure there were
two tiers of ancient cellars, one below the other,
forming part of the original medi&aelig;val mansion
once owned by the Creswick family; and the
removal of these was attended with much
difficulty. The new building was opened for
business on the 4th November, 1889.</p>

<p>The superficial area of the ground on which the

square feet. The new site joins the present Post
Office structure, and has a frontage of 88 feet to
Small Street. Its area is 11,715 superficial feet,
so that the enlargement will be considerable but
by no means excessive, having regard to the
extremely rapid development of the Bristol Post

<p class="center">ELIZABETHAN POST TO BRISTOL.&mdash;THE QUEEN'S PROGRESS,
1574.</p>


<p>Particulars are on record respecting a very
early Post from the Court of Queen Elizabeth
to Bristol. At that period it occupied more days
for the Monarch to travel in Sovereign State to
Bristol than it does hours in these days of Great
Western "fliers." It seems that Queen Elizabeth
made a Progress to Bristol in 1574. She travelled
from London by way of Woodstock and Berkeley.
She arrived at Bristol, August 14, 1574, and had
a splendid and elaborate reception:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before the Queen left Bristol she knighted her
host, John Young, who, in return for the honour
done him, gave her a jewel containing rubies and
diamonds, and ornamented with a Ph&oelig;nix and
Salamander. She did not get quit of the city
until after she had listened to many weary verses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
describing the tears and sorrows of the citizens
at her departure, and their earnest prayer for her
prosperity. From Bristol she travelled to Sir
T. Thynne's, at Longleat, and from Longleat
across Salisbury Plain to the Earl of Pembroke's,
at Wilton, where she arrived September 3rd."</p>

<p>The British Museum records show that in 1580
Ireland was in rebellion. A Spanish-Italian force
of eight hundred men had been sent, with at
least the connivance of Philip II. of Spain, to
assist the rebels, and the English Government
was compelled to hurry reinforcements and
supplies to Ireland. These reinforcements and
supplies went by way of Bristol, and it was at that
juncture of affairs that a post was established
between London, or Richmond, where the Court
was, and Bristol. This post, if not actually the
first, was certainly one of the earliest posts to
Bristol.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Privy Council held September
26, 1580, a warrant was issued "to Robert
Gascoigne for laying of post horses between
London and Bristol, requiring Her Majesty's
officers to be assisting unto him in this service."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
A warrant was also issued "to Sir Thomas
Heneage, Knight, Treasurer of her Majesty's
Chamber, to pay unto Robert Gascoigne the sum
of ten pounds to be employed about the service
of laying post horses between London and
Bristol."</p>

<p>The duty of laying this post was not entrusted
to the Master of the Posts, Thomas Randolph,
but to Gascoigne, the Postmaster of the Court,
who usually arranged the posts rendered necessary
by Queen Elizabeth's progresses through
her dominions. Gascoigne afterwards furnished
an account of what he had done to carry out the
Order of the Privy Council, and from this document,
which is preserved at the Record Office in
London, it seems that the post travelled from
Richmond, or London, to Hounslow, and thence
to Maidenhead (16 miles), Newbury (21 miles),
Marlborough (16 miles), Chippenham (22 miles),
and thence to Bristol (20 miles). The cost of the
post for a month of 28 days is stated to have been
&pound;14 9s.; but it does not appear if this amount is
in addition to the &pound;10 ordered to be paid to
Gascoigne for laying the post; nor is there any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>thing
to show how often the post travelled, or for
how long it was maintained; Gascoigne describes
it as an "extraordinary" post. At that time
the only ordinary posts were from London to
Berwick, Holyhead, and Dover respectively. It
is, perhaps, as well to add that these posts were
the Queen's posts, and were only intended for the
conveyance of persons travelling on her service
or of packets sent on her business, though other
persons used the posts for travelling and for
sending letters.</p>

<p>Several complaints were made by Leonard
Dutton and another against Robert Gascoigne,
Postmaster of the Court, in respect of abuses
connected with the posts thus laid down for
Queen Elizabeth's use while on a "Progress." The
complainants charged Gascoigne with neglect of
duty, laying posts to suit his own convenience,
delaying letters, making improper charges, and
stopping something for himself out of money he
should have paid in wages, etc. Among the
papers relating to this affair is a copy of part of
Gascoigne's account, of which the following
is a transcript:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>As to the Marlborough post, Anthony Ditton
was Mayor of the town, as appears from a certificate
by him (which is with the papers) that he
only received from Gascoigne 15s. for the posts.
Gascoigne claimed to have paid at Marlborough
34s. (see the transcript of his account), and if
Ditton was entitled to half that sum Gascoigne
pocketed 4s. (&pound;19 15s. 4d.). This is the sort of
thing Ditton charged him with doing. To these
charges Gascoigne gave a denial, separately explaining
each charge. His explanation was
accepted, inasmuch as he was continued in office.</p>

COACH INNOVATIONS, 1660-1818.</p></div>


<p>In 1660-1661, James Hicks, Clerk to "The
Roads" in the Letter Office, petitions the
King to be continued in office. He says he sent
the first letter from Nantwich to London in 1637,
and was sent for in 1640 to be Clerk for that
Road (Chester Road). Had settled in 1642
"Postages between BRISTOL and YORK for
your late father's service."</p>

<p>In 1661, Henry Bisshopp, farmer of the Post
Office, furnished to the Secretary of State "a
perfect list" of all officers in the Post Office.
According to this list there were eight Clerks of
the Roads, viz.:&mdash;Two of the Northern Road,
two of the Chester Road, two of the Eastern
Road, and Two of the Western Road. In 1677,
there were, in addition to these Roads, the Bristol
Road and the Kent Road. As there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Post-House at Bristol in 1661, no doubt the city
was attached to the Western Road.</p>

A STATE COACH OF THE PERIOD (17TH CENTURY) WHEN KING CHARLES I. SOJOURNED
AT SMALL STREET, BRISTOL, ON THE SITE OF THE PRESENT POST OFFICE.</span>
</div>

<p>There were only six stage-coaches known in
1662. A journey that could not be performed on
horseback was rarely undertaken then by those
who could not afford their own steeds.</p>

<p>Amongst the State papers in May, 1666, is an
account of the time spent in carrying the mails
on the chief routes throughout the country.
Although the speed fixed by the Government for
the postboys was seven miles an hour in the
summer months, the actual rate attained on the
Bristol, Chester, and York Roads was only four
miles, and was half-a-mile less on the Gloucester
and Plymouth routes. An appended note stated
that a man spent seventeen or eighteen hours in
riding from Winchester to Southampton. In
December, Lord Arlington complained to the
postal authorities that the King's letters from
Bristol and other towns were delayed from ten
to fourteen hours beyond the proper time, and
ordered that the Postmasters should be threatened
with dismissal unless they reformed.</p>

<p>In 1667 a London and Oxford Coach was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
performing the 54 miles between the two cities
in two days, halting for the intervening night at
Beaconsfield: and in the same year the original
Bath Coach was the subject of this proclamation:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Flying Machine.</span>"&mdash;"All those desirous of
passing from London to Bath, or any other place
on their Road, let them repair to the 'Belle
Sauvage' on Ludgate Hill, in London, and the
'White Lion' at Bath, at both which places
they may be received in a Stage Coach, every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which performs
the whole journey in Three Days (if God permit)
and sets forth at 5 o'clock in the Morning.</p>

<p>"Passengers to pay One Pound Five Shillings
each, who are allowed to carry fourteen Pounds
Weight&mdash;for all above to pay three-halfpence per

<p>It was only after repeated appeals to the
Government that a "Cross Post" was established
between Bristol and Exeter for inland letters
in 1698, thus substituting a journey of under 80
miles for one of nearly 300, when the letters
were carried through London. In this case,
however, Bristol letters to and from Ireland were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
excluded from the scheme, and they still had to
pass through the Metropolis.</p>

</div>

<p>Even at a later date, when strong representations
were made to the Post Office, Ralph Allen,
of Bath, who had the control of the Western
Mails, refused to allow a direct communication
between Bristol and Ireland, but offered if the
postage from Dublin to London were paid, to
convey the letters to Bristol gratis.</p>

<p>At this period there were quaint public waggons
on the Bristol Road, as depicted in the illustration.</p>

<p>The "Pack Horse" at Chippenham, and the
"Old Pack Horse," and the "Pack Horse and
Talbot," at Turnham Green, were, in 1739, halting
places of the numerous Packmen who travelled
on the Bristol and Western Road.</p>

<p>By 1742 a stage-coach left London at seven
every morning, stayed for dinner at noon in
Uxbridge, arrived at High Wycombe by four in
the afternoon, and rested there all night, proceeding
to Oxford the next day. Men were content
to get to York in six days, and to Exeter in a
fortnight.</p>

<p>In 1760, in consequence of frequent complaints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as to the dilatoriness of the postal service, the
authorities in London announced that letters or
packets would thenceforth be dispatched from the
capital to the chief provincial towns "at any hour
without loss of time," at certain specified rates.
An express to Bristol was to cost &pound;2 3s. 6d.; to
Plymouth, &pound;4 8s. 9d. Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham,
Liverpool, were not even mentioned.</p>

<p>The mail-coach system had its origin in the
West of England, and Bristol and Bath in particular
are associated with all the traditions of the
initiatory stages, so that the details on record in
ancient newspapers of those cities are copious.</p>

<p>Mr. John Weeks, who entered upon "The
Bush," Bristol, in 1772, after ineffectually urging
the proprietors to quicken their speed, started a
one-day coach to Birmingham himself, and carried
it on against a bitter opposition, charging the
passengers only 10s. 6d. and 8s. 6d. for inside
and outside seats respectively, and giving each one
of them a dinner and a pint of wine at Gloucester
into the bargain. After two years' struggle, his
opponents gave in, and one-day journeys to
Birmingham became the established rule.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon after this period, John Palmer, of Bath,
came on the scene. He had learnt from the
merchants of Bristol what a boon it would be if
they could get their letters conveyed to London
in fourteen or fifteen hours, instead of three days.
John Palmer was lessee and manager of the Bath
and Bristol theatres, and went about beating up
actors, actresses, and companies in postchaises,
and he thought letters should be carried at the
same pace at which it was possible to travel in a
chaise. He devised a scheme, and Pitt, the Prime
Minister of the day, who warmly approved the
idea, decided that the plan should have a trial,
and that the first mail-coach should run between
London and Bristol. On Saturday, July 31, 1784,
an agreement was signed in connection with
Palmer's scheme under which, in consideration of
payment of 3d. a mile, five inn-holders&mdash;one
belonging to London, one to Thatcham, one to
Marlborough, and two to Bath&mdash;undertook to
provide the horses, and on Monday, August 2,
1784, the first "mail-coach" started.</p>

<p>The following was the Post Office announcement
respecting the service:&mdash;"General Post Office,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
July 24, 1784. His Majesty's Postmaster-General
being inclined to make an experiment for the more
expeditious conveyance of the mails of letters by
stage-coaches, machines, etc., have (<i>sic</i>) been
pleased to order that a trial shall be made upon
the road between London and Bristol, to commence
at each place on Monday, August 2 next,
and that the mails should be made up at this office
every evening (Sundays excepted) at 7 o'clock,
and at Bristol, in return, at 3 in the afternoon
(Saturdays excepted), to contain the bags for the
following post towns and their districts&mdash;viz.:
Hounslow&mdash;between 9 and 10 at night from
London; between 6 and 7 in the morning from
Bristol. Maidenhead&mdash;between 11 and 12 at

<p>The public were also informed that the mail diligence
would commence to run on Monday, August
2, 1784&mdash;and that the proprietors had engaged
to carry the mail to and from London to Bristol
in sixteen hours, starting from the Swan with Two
Necks, in Lad Lane, London, at 8 o'clock each
night, and arriving at the Three Tuns, Bath,
before 10 o'clock the next morning, and at the
Rummer Tavern, Bristol, by 12 o'clock. "The mail
is to leave Bristol from the Swan Tavern for
London every afternoon at 4 o'clock, and to arrive
in London before 8 o'clock the next morning."</p>

<p>On August 5, we are told, "the new mail
diligence set off for the first time from Bristol on
Monday last, at 4 o'clock, and from Bath at
5.20 p.m. From London it set out at 8 o'clock in
the evening, and was in Bath by 9 o'clock the next
morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"The excellent steps taken to carry out this
undertaking leave no doubt of its succeeding, to
the great advantage and pleasure to the publick.
The mail from this city is made up at 5 o'clock."
This grand achievement of Palmer's was signalised
by the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"A safe and quick method is found to convey<br />
Our bills of exchange, and I promise to pay.<br />
Political news from all parts of the town,<br />
The Senate, the play, and each place of renown.<br />

Will daily applaud Mr. Palmer's New Stage."<br />
</div>

<p>No sooner was success apparent than troubles
commenced, as may be gathered from the following
paragraph, dated September 9, 1784:&mdash;"Bath.
We hear that the contractors for carrying the mail
to and from this city and London have received
the most positive orders to direct their coachmen:
on no account whatever to try their speed against
other carriages that may be set up in opposition
to them, nor to suffer them to discharge firearms
in passing through any towns, or on the road,
except they are attacked."</p>

<p>"They have generally performed their duty with
great care and punctuality, within an hour of the
contracted time and perfectly to the satisfaction
of the Government and the publick, and this
before any opposition was commenced against
them, and when it was thought impossible to effect
it in sixteen hours instead of fifteen hours. Their
steady line of conduct will be their best recommendation
to this city, which, much to its honour, has supported
them with great spirit. Attempts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> by other drivers of other
coaches, or any other persons whatsoever, to impede the
mail diligence on its journey will be certainly attended
with the most serious prosecutions to the parties so
offending.</p>

<p>"We are desired by the old proprietors of the
Bath coaches to insert the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Last Sunday evening, as the coachman of the
mail diligence was driving furiously down Kennet
Hill, between Calne and Marlborough, in order to
overtake the two guard coaches, the coach was
suddenly thrown against the bank, by which
means a lady was much hurt, as was also the
driver. The lady was taken out and safely
conveyed in one of the guard coaches to Marlborough.'</p>

<p>"We are informed:&mdash;The proprietors of the two
coaches, with a guard to each, which travel from
Bristol to London in fifteen hours have instructed
their servants not to fire their arms wantonly,
but to be particularly vigilant in case of attack.
The proprietors of these coaches are determined
to have the passengers and property protected
and for the safety of both have ordered their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
coachmen to keep together to make assurance
doubly sure."</p>

</div>

<p>September 16, 1784:&mdash;"Our mail diligence still
continues its course with the same steadiness and
punctuality. Yesterday its coachman and guard
made their first appearance in Royal livery, and
cut a most superior figure. It is certainly very
proper that the Government carriages should be
thus distinguished; such a mark of His Majesty's
approbation does the contractors great honour,
and it is with much pleasure we see so great a
change in the conveyance of our mail&mdash;not only
in its speed and safety, but in its present respectable
appearance, from an old cart and a ragged boy."</p>

<p>December 16, 1784:&mdash;"A writer, under the
signature of 'An Enemy to Schemers,' having
published in the <i>Gazette</i> several letters against the
new mode of conveying the mail, another writer,
under the signature of 'Lash,' has in a masterly
manner replied to all his arguments in that paper
of Monday, and has severely censured the conduct
of Mr. Todd of the Post Office."</p>

<p>December 16, 1784:&mdash;"Dear Sir,&mdash;I have just
received some newspapers from a friend in Bath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
containing an abusive letter against my post
plan, and two answers to it under the signature
of 'Lash.' I rather think that the latter may be
yours, and think myself much obliged to you for
the warmth with which you have taken the matter
up, but could wish you would take no further
notice of it. The letter, if I recollect right, merely
contains the refuse of the observations, sent from
the Post Office to the Treasury, which have been
fully refuted to the board. It might appear these
are like doubting the justice of that Court were
I to suffer myself to be decoyed or provoked into
another. Two years have already been wasted
in wrangling, and I am heartily weary of it. Since
my return I have the satisfaction to find the public,
if possible, still more pleased from the experience
they have had of the punctuality as well as the
expedition of the post in all possible cases, in every
variety of weather our climate gives. And those
who express their surprise that the plan is not
extended yet to other parts of the kingdom I
have taken care to tell the plain truth&mdash;that it is
entirely Mr. Todd's fault. I could not express
my sense of his exceeding ill conduct at the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>mencement
of the trial (so very different from his
profession) in a stronger manner than in my
memorial to the Treasury; nor could they do me
ampler justice than in the resolutions they passed
on the occasion and sent to the Post Office. It
should not therefore be stated to the public his
stopping the Norfolk and Suffolk service by his
assertion of the enormous expenses of the new
beyond the old system, and his strange declaration
that the number of letters sent by the Bath
and Bristol post had decreased and in consequence
of its improvement are so ill-supported by the
statements sent to the Treasury, and the reverse
of these charges so fully established in my answers
that I believe there is an end of the controversy,
and have very little doubt but that I shall shortly
receive the Ministers' commands to carry the plan
into execution to the other parts of the kingdom.
To do this (and I have not the least fear of accomplishing
it) will be the most decisive answer to
abuse, and more satisfactory to the publick. I
rather think, too, from the number of memorials
sent in favour of my plan, and the general indignation
expressed at the mismanagement of the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
post, Mr. Todd will find it prudent to desist from
further opposition. Nothing possible can be in
better train than the plan is or in the hands of
persons more anxious for its success. It would
be very imprudent, therefore, to run the least
hazard of disturbing it. I beg you'll not imagine
I am the least displeased at what you have done.
On the contrary, I am really much obliged to you;
and be assured I shall never forget the zeal and
attention I have experienced from you in the
course of this business, and that you will always
find me your sincere friend.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Palmer</span>,

<p>December 16, 1784:&mdash;"Our mail carriage has,
if possible, added to its reputation from its extraordinary
and ready exertions on the bad weather
setting in. It arrived here on Saturday an hour
only after its time, and this morning was within
the limited time. The Salisbury mail, which
should have come in on Saturday by eight in the
morning did not arrive till Sunday morning."</p>

which enables business people to stay here longer."</p>

<p>On February 22, 1785, the Town Council minutes
contain the following:&mdash;"Mr. May acquainted
the members present that the inhabitants of this
city, as well as those of other places, having
derived great benefit from Mr. Palmer's plan
lately adopted for the improvement of the post,
was the occasion of his calling them together to
consider such measures as might be thought
proper for continuance and extension of the
said plan.... It was resolved that a
memorial be sent to the Right Hon. Wm. Pitt,
representing the great benefits received from the
plan, and requesting a continuance of the same,
together with the extension of the same plan to
other parts of the kingdom."</p>

<p>February 17, 1785:&mdash;"At a meeting of the
Bristol Merchants' Society on Saturday last, a
vote of thanks was passed to Mr. John Palmer for
the advantages received from his postal plan."</p>

<p>February 24, 1785:&mdash;"Memorials appear to the

<p>On March 24, 1785, appeared the following

of the House of Commons, we have been unable to

he always hoped that plan would afford, and in

Gosport, Chichester, and their delivery,
together with the Isle of Wight, Jersey and
Guernsey, all parts of Hampshire and Dorsetshire,

from the above places will arrive here every
morning, Mondays excepted:</p>

<p>"N.B.&mdash;All letters must be put in the office

<p>May 18, 1785:&mdash;"We hear that Mr. Palmer's
plan for conveying the mails will be adopted from
London to Manchester through Leicester and
Derby, and to Leeds through Nottingham, at
Midsummer."</p>

<p>June 9, 1785:&mdash;"Mr. Williams, the public-spirited
master of the Three Tuns Inn, and the
chief contractor for conveying the mails, had in
the morning of this day placed in the front of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
house His Majesty's Arms, neatly carved in gilt.
In the evening his house was illuminated in a very
elegant manner with variegated lamps, the
principal figure in which was the letters 'G.R.'
immediately over the coat-of-arms. A band of
music with horns played several tunes adapted to
the day, and a recruiting party drawn up before
the doors with drums and fifes playing at intervals
had a very pleasing effect."</p>

<p>On June 30, 1785, appeared the following paragraph,
which shows how complete was the success
of John Palmer's post plan, in spite of all the
obstacles placed in his way to obstruct his scheme.
We are now informed that the "mail-coaches and
diligences have been found to answer so well that
they will be generally adopted throughout the
kingdom, and conveying of them in carts will be
discontinued."</p>

<p>On June 30 appeared a long letter showing
how the G.P.O. tried to overthrow Mr. Palmer's
scheme. This is signed Thomas Symons, Bristol,
and describes the scheme as the most beneficial
plan that ever was thought of for a commercial
country. He also complains of the misconduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the Post Office, as letters had been miscarried
to Dublin, which caused the merchants of Bristol
considerable annoyance, and this mismanagement
without hesitation he declares was by design, in
order to try and overthrow this most excellent
system of John Palmer's post.</p>

<p>Early in 1787, Palmer had to represent to the
Contractors that the Mails must be carried by
more reliable coaches.</p>

<p>"The Comptroller-General," he wrote to one
Contractor, "has to complain not only of the
horses employed on the Bristol mail, but as well
of their harness and the accoutrements in use,
whose defects have several times delayed the Bath
and Bristol letters, and have even led to the
conveyance being overset, to the imminent peril
of the passengers.</p>

<p>"Instructions have been issued by the Comptroller
for new sets of harness to be supplied to the
several coaches in use on this road, for which
accounts will be sent you by the harness-makers.
Mr. Palmer stated also that he had under consideration,
for the Contractor's use, a new-invented
coach."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this, Palmer's active connection with
the Post Office ceased. He died at Brighton in
1818.</p>

<p>What he looked like at the age of 17 and 75
respectively, is shewn in the illustrations, the
former taken from a picture attributed to Gainsborough.</p>

<div class="blockquot">APPRECIATIONS OF RALPH ALLEN, JOHN PALMER, AND SIR
FRANCIS FREELING, MAIL AND COACH ADMINISTRATORS.</div>


<p>On the 25th April, 1901, the day after a visit
to Bristol to celebrate the establishment
of the new steamship line to Jamaica, the
Marquess of Londonderry, then Postmaster-General,
visited Bath to take part in a ceremony
in honour of Ralph Allen and John Palmer.
These two great postal reformers were both
citizens of Bath, and are greatly honoured in that
city for their work in the Post Office, with the
famous men of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. By a happy thought there
has lately been started a movement to keep alive
associations with the past by placing tablets on
the houses in which famous men lived. One of
the tablets unveiled by Lord Londonderry was
placed on the house in which Ralph Allen first
conducted the business of the Bath Post Office,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and of his cross post contracts, and the other on
the house in which John Palmer was born.</p>

<p>Soon after noon on the eventful day, the Bath
postmen's band, Mr. Kerans, the postmaster, and
his lieutenants, the staff of postmen and messengers,
marched on to the space between the Abbey
and the Guildhall for inspection by the Head of
the Post Office Department. After the inspection,
a procession was formed, in which the Postmaster-General
was accompanied by the Mayor, and
followed by the Town Councillors, two by two.
Before them went the city swordbearer, clad in
striking robes, and the party proceeded to the
North Parade, from which Allen's house is now
reached by a passage way. The house is built of
stone, and has a very handsome front in the
style of the classical Renaissance. In drawing
aside the curtain, which veiled the tablet, on
which was inscribed "Here lived Ralph Allen,
1727-1764," Lord Londonderry said that there
was probably not one of the great men who had
been associated with Bath who was more of a
benefactor to his town, as well as to the public
service of his country, than Ralph Allen. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
procession then moved on to Palmer's house, only
a few yards away, where a similar ceremony took
place. After another short speech by the Postmaster-General,
in which he explained the share
Palmer had borne in developing the modern Post
Office system, the second tablet was unveiled.
It bore the inscription, "Here lived John Palmer,
born 1741, died 1818."</p>

<p>Afterwards at the Guildhall, where a bust of
Allen in the Council Chamber looked down upon
a large party assembled for luncheon, the Postmaster-General,
in response to the toast of his
health, discoursed more at large upon the topic
of the day. He congratulated Bath upon having
among its citizens two out of the four great men
of Post Office history. It was Allen's task to
provide a general postal system by opening up
new lines of posts between the main roads, and
through new lines of country. Between 1720,
when he began his first contract, and 1764 when
he died, he covered the country with a network of
posts, giving easy communication between all
important towns, and he also increased the number
and speed of the mails on the post roads. While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
doing this he raised himself from being a humble
clerk, and later, postmaster of Bath, to a position
of great affluence, and of friendship with many of
the great men of his time. Among those friends
was Lord Chatham.</p>

<p>It was twenty years after Allen's death that
Palmer's Mail Coach system was started. Its
advantage soon made itself apparent, and the
improvement of roads at the end of the 18th
Century enabled the mail coach service to be
brought to great perfection. It lasted less than
60 years, but in those years correspondence and
the revenue of the Post Office multiplied many
times, and when Rowland Hill turned his attention
to postal questions he found a rapid and efficient
service, which was at the same time so cheap that
the cost of conveyance was only a small item in
the expenses of the Post Office.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Bath proposed the toast of "the
Visitors," and said that they had amongst them
two representatives of the great men they were
honouring. Ralph Allen was represented by
Colonel Allen, a direct descendant, and the owner
of Bathampton Manor, a part of Ralph Allen's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
estate. Colonel Allen had lately returned from
South Africa. John Palmer was represented by
his grandson, Colonel Palmer, R.E.</p>

<p class="center"><b>MEDAL STRUCK IN HONOUR OF RALPH ALLEN.</b></p>


<p>Colonel Allen thanked the company for their
kind reception, and Colonel Palmer said that it
had given him the greatest pleasure to witness
the testimonial to his grandfather's services, and
this pleasure would be shared by the members of
his family, including his sister, who had given the
cup on the table to the Corporation. It had been
a present from the Citizens of Glasgow to John
Palmer.</p>

<p>Full accounts of the Post Office services of
Allen and Palmer are written in "The Bristol
Royal Mail."</p>

<p>The photograph of a curious memorial of
Ralph Allen's work in the Post Office here
reproduced is that of a medal bearing the
Royal Arms, and the inscriptions "To the
Famous Mr. Allen, 4th December, 1752," and
"the Gift of His Royal Highness, W.D. of
Cumberland."</p>

<p>The reverse of the medal is engraved with some
Masonic emblems, and with the words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">
"Amor Honor Justitia,"<br />
<span class="smcap">Ino Campbell</span>,<br />
Armagh.<br />
No. 409.<br />
</p>

<p>The history of this relic is rather obscure. It
was purchased in a curiosity shop in Belfast some
fifteen years ago by Mr. D. Buick, LL.D., of Sandy
Bay, Larne. In the year 1752, the Princess
Amelia visited Bath, and was entertained by
Ralph Allen at Prior Park. During her stay at
Bath, the Duke of Cumberland also visited the
town, and is known to have contributed &pound;100 to
the Bath Hospital, of which Allen was one of the
most active supporters. It has been surmised
that the medal was intended as an acknowledgment
of the courtesy and attention received by
the Duke and the Princess on this occasion.</p>

<p>Whether the medal was ever presented is not
known, or how it came to be converted into a
Masonic jewel. Perhaps it may have been given
away by Allen, or it may have gone astray, or
been stolen. The Masonic Lodge, No. 409, is
said to have been founded by a Mr. John Campbell
in 1761, shortly before the date of Allen's
death: Allen may have been a Freemason.</p>

TOKENS COMMEMORATIVE OF PALMER&#39;S MAIL COACH SYSTEM.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>It is to Mr. Sydenham, of Bath, that indebtedness
is due for the interesting impressions of
tokens struck in commemoration of Palmer's mail
coach system here depicted.</p>

<p>An interesting tribute was the painting by
George Robertson, engraved by James Fittler,
and inscribed to him as Comptroller-General in
1803, eleven years after he had ceased to hold
that position. A copy of this engraving appears
in "The Bristol Royal Mail." Palmer also received
the freedom of eighteen towns and cities in recognition
of his public services, was Mayor of Bath
in 1796 and 1801, and represented that city in
the four Parliaments of 1801, 1802, 1806, and
1807.</p>

<p>Francis Freeling, who succeeded John Palmer
in the Secretaryship and General Managership of
Post Office affairs, was as a youth a disciple of
his predecessor, and assisted him in the development
of the Mail Coach system. He was apprenticed
to the Post Office in Bristol, where his
talents, rectitude of conduct, and assiduity in the
duties assigned him gained for him the esteem
and respect of all those connected with the estab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>lishment;
and, on the introduction by Mr. Palmer
of the new system of Mail Coaches, Mr. Freeling
was appointed in 1785 his assistant to carry the
improvements into effect. He was introduced
into the General Post Office in 1787, and successively
filled the office of surveyor, principal
surveyor, joint secretary with the late Anthony
Todd, Esq., and sole secretary for nearly half a
century.</p>

<p>In Mr. Dix's "Life of Chatterton," it is stated,
on the authority of a friend of the Chatterton
family, that on Chatterton leaving for London,
"he took leave of several friends on the steps
of Redcliff Church very cheerfully. That at
parting from them he went over the way to
Mr. Freeling's house." It is further stated
that Mr. Freeling was father to the late
Sir F. Freeling.</p>

<p>As regards Freeling's birthplace, information
is forthcoming which seems conclusive. In a
collection of old Bristol sketches purchased for
the Museum and Library, there is a beautiful
drawing of Redcliffe Hill, executed about eighty
years ago; and the artist, doubtless acting on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the evidence of old inhabitants&mdash;contemporaries
of Freeling&mdash;has distinctly marked the house
where that gentleman was born, and noted the
fact in his own handwriting.</p>

<span class="caption">+ BIRTHPLACE OF SIR FRANCIS FREELING, BART.,<br /><br />

<i>Secretary to the General Post Office.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Permission has been obtained from the council
of the Bristol Museum and Reference Library for
the picture to be photographed. The following
is the superscription on the back of the original
pencil drawing:&mdash;"Redcliffe Pit, Bristol. The
house with this mark + at the door is the house
in which Sir Francis Freeling, Bart., was born.
The high building, George's patent shot tower,
G. Delamotte, del. Jan. 12, 1831." A copy of
the sketch is here reproduced. The house as
"set back" or re-erected is now known as 24, Redcliffe
Hill.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Freeling first carried on his secretarial
duties at the old Post Office in Lombard
Street, once a citizen's Mansion. There he was
located for 30 years.</p>

<p>On September 29th, 1829, the Lombard Street
Office was abandoned as Headquarters, and
Freeling moved, with the secretarial staff under
his chieftainship, to St. Martin's-le-Grand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1833 the question arose whether the mail
coaches should be obtained by public competition,
or by private agreement, but Sir Francis Freeling's
idea was to get the public service done well,
irrespective of the means.</p>

<p>On this point Mr. Joyce, C.B., in his history of
the Post Office, wrote that in 1835 the contract
for the supply of mail coaches was in the hands
of Mr. Vidler, of Millbank, who had held it for
more than 40 years, and little had been done
during this period to improve the construction of
the vehicles he supplied. Designed after the
pattern in vogue at the end of the last century,
they were, as compared with the stage coaches,
not only heavy and unsightly, but inferior both
in point of speed and accommodation. Commissioners
appointed to inquire into the system,
altogether dissatisfied with the manner in which
the contract had been performed, arranged with
the Government not only that the service should
be put up to public tender, but that Vidler should
be excluded from the competition. This decision
was arrived at in July, 1835, and the contract
expired on the 5th of January following. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
invite tenders would occupy time, and after that
mail coaches would have to be built sufficient in
number to supply the whole of England and
Scotland. A period of five or six months was
obviously not enough for the purpose, and overtures
were made to Vidler to continue his contract
for half a year longer. Vidler, incensed at
the treatment he had received, flatly refused.
Not a day, not an hour, beyond the stipulated
time would he extend his contract, and on the
5th of January, 1836, all the mail coaches in Great
Britain would be withdrawn from the roads.
Freeling, now an old man, with this difficulty to
overcome, had his old energy revived, and when
the 5th of January arrived there was not a road
in the kingdom, from Wick to Penzance, on which
a new coach was not running. It was then that
the mail coaches reached their prime.</p>

<p>Amongst the deaths announced in the
<i>Felix Farley's Journal</i> under date of January 14th,
1804, is that of "the lady of Francis Freeling,
Esq., of the General Post Office," and another
part of the paper contains the following paragraph:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The untimely death of Mrs. Freeling is
lamented far beyond the circle of her own family,
extensive as it is. The amiableness of her manner
and the rational accomplishments of her mind
had conciliated a general esteem for such worth,
through numerous classes of respectable friends,
who naturally participate in its loss."</p>

<p>Freeling's obituary notice, which appeared in the
same <i>Journal</i> on July 16, 1836, ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Saturday last, died at his residence in
Bryanston Square, London, in the 73rd year of
his age, Sir Francis Freeling, Bart., upwards of
30 years Secretary to the General Post Office.
Sir Francis was a native of Bristol&mdash;he was born
in Redcliffe Parish&mdash;and first became initiated in
the laborious and multifarious duties attendant
upon the important branch of the public service
in which he was engaged in the Post Office of this
city of Bristol, from whence he was removed to
the Metropolitan Office in Lombard Street, on the
recommendation of Mr. Palmer, the former M.P.
and Father of George Palmer, the present member
for Bath, who had observed during the period
he was employed in first establishing the mail-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>coach
department the quickness of apprehension,
the aptitude for business, and the steadiness of
conduct of his youthful prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Sir Francis
rapidly rose to notice and preferment in his new
situation; and after his succession to the office
of Chief Secretary, it is proverbial that no public
servant ever gave more general satisfaction by
his indefatigable attention to the interests of the
community, or than he invariably shewed to those
of the meanest individual who addressed him;
whether from a peer or peasant, a letter of complaint
always received a prompt reply. The
present admirable arrangements and conveniences
of that noble national establishment, the newly-erected
Post Office, were formed upon the experience
and the suggestions of Sir Francis and
his eldest son. A more faithful and zealous
servant the public never possessed. The title
he enjoyed was the unsolicited reward for his
services, bestowed upon him by his Royal Master
George the 4th, from whom he frequently received
other flattering testimonials of regard and
friendship. In Sir Francis Freeling was to be
found one of those instances which so frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
occur in this country of the sure reward to
industry and talent when brought into public
notice. In speaking of his private character,
those only can appreciate his worth who saw him
in the bosom of his family&mdash;to his fond and
affectionate children his loss will be irreparable.
To possess his friendship was to have gained his
heart, for it may be truly said he never forgot
the friend who had won his confidence; particularly
if the individual was one who, like himself,
had wanted the fostering hand of a superior.
Sir Francis was always found to be the ready
and liberal patron of talent in every department
of literature, science, and the fine arts. Considering
the importance and multiplicity of his
public avocations, it was surprising to all his
friends how he could have found leisure to store
his mind with the knowledge he had attained of
the works and beauties of all our most esteemed
writers; his library contains one of the rarest
and most curious collections of our early authors,
more particularly our poets and dramatists; in
the acquirement of these works he was engaged
long before it became the fashion to purchase a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
black letter poem, or romance, merely because it
was old or unique. But his highest excellencies
were the virtuous and religious principles which
governed his whole life; his purse was ever open
to relieve the distress of an unfortunate friend,
or the wants of the deserving poor. Many
were the alms which he bestowed in secret;
which can be testified by the writer of this
paragraph, who knew him well, and enjoyed his
friendship."</p>

<p>Miss Edith Freeling, now resident in Clifton,
grand-daughter of Sir Francis Freeling, and
daughter of Sir Henry Freeling, and who was
actually born in the General Post Office, St.
Martin's-le-Grand, London, where her father had
a residence as Assistant Secretary, has in her
possession several "antiques" belonging to her
ancestors.</p>

<p>A worn-out despatch box used by Sir Francis
in sending his papers to the Postmaster-General
is one of the prized articles. A very handsome
gold seal cut with the Royal Arms, and bearing
the legend&mdash;General Post Office Secretary&mdash;is
another of the relics. Likewise a smaller gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
seal with a Crown, and "God Save the King,"
as its legend.</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Sir Francis Freeling's
snuff boxes numbered 72, the majority of which
had been presented to him. Apparently "appreciations"
took a tangible form in those days!
His son, Sir Henry, likewise had snuff boxes
presented to him.</p>

<p>A handsome specimen snuff box is now in Miss
Freeling's hands. It is made of tortoise-shell, it
has the portrait of King George the IVth as a gold
medallion on the top, and was known as a Regency
Box. The inscription inside is, "This box was
presented to G.H. Freeling by His Majesty
George IVth on board the Lightning steam packet
on his birthday twelfth August 1821 as a remembrance
that we had been carried to Ireland in a
Steam Boat." As Sir Francis Freeling migrated
from the Bristol service to Bath in 1784, it must
have been at the Old Bristol Post Office, near the
Exchange, indicated by the illustration, that he
commenced that public career which was destined
to be one of brilliant achievements for the department
during the many years he presided over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
it as permanent chief, and of great good to his
country in the way of providing means for people
to communicate with each other more readily
than was the case before his day.</p>

NEW GENERAL POST OFFICE, LONDON.</div>


<p>How our forefathers got about the country,
and how the Mails were carried as time
went on after Allen and Palmer had disappeared
from Mail scenes, and Freeling had taken up the
reins, the following announcements, taken from
<i>Bonner and Middleton's Bristol Journal</i>, and
from the <i>Bristol Mirror</i> respecting Mail Stage
Coaches will aptly indicate. They are quoted
just as they appeared, so that editing may not
spoil their originality or interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A letter from Exeter, dated May 10, 1802,
said:&mdash;'Last Thursday the London mail, horsed
by Mr. J. Land, of the New London Inn, Exeter,
with four beautiful grey horses, and driven by
Mr. Cave-Browne, of the Inniskilling Dragoons,
started (at the sound of the bugle) from St.
Sydwells, for a bet of 500 guineas, against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Plymouth mail, horsed by Mr. Phillips, of the
Hotel, with four capital blacks, and driven by Mr.
Chichester, of Arlington House, which got the
mail first to the Post Office in Honiton. The
bet was won easily by Mr. Browne, who drove the
sixteen miles in one hour and fourteen minutes.&mdash;Bets
at starting, 6 to 4 on Mr. Browne. A very
great concourse of people were assembled on this
occasion.'"</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 2, 1802, it was announced
that "the Union post coach ran from Bristol
every Sunday, Wednesday and Friday morning
over the Old Passage, through Chepstow and
Monmouth to Hereford, where it met other
coaches, and returned the following days. Coaches
left the White Hart Inn and the Bush Tavern for
Exeter and Plymouth every morning, by the
nearest road by ten miles. Fares: To Exeter,
inside, &pound;1 1s.; outside, 14s.; to Plymouth,
&pound;1 11s. 6d. and &pound;1 1s. Reduced fares are offered
by the London, Bath, and Bristol mail coaches&mdash;to
and from London to Bristol, inside, &pound;2 5s.;
from London to Bath, &pound;2. Parcels under 6lb.
in weight taken at 6d. each, with an engagement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to be responsible for the safe delivery of such as
are under &pound;5 in value."</p>

<p>In August, 1803, passenger traffic to Birmingham
caused rivalry among the coach proprietors. A
new coach having started on this route, three
coaching advertisements were issued:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under the heading "Cheap Travelling to
Birmingham," the "Jupiter" coach was announced
to run from the White Lion, Broad Street, every
Monday and Friday afternoon, at two o'clock;
through Newport, Gloucester, Tewkesbury, and
Worcester to Birmingham; the "Nelson" coach
from the Bush Tavern and White Hart every
morning at three; and the mail every evening at
seven. "Performed by Weeks, Williams, Poston,
Coupland and Co."</p>

<p>The "Union" coach altered its times of leaving
the Boar's Head, College Place&mdash;"in order to
render the conveyance as commodious and expeditious
as possible"&mdash;to Sunday, Tuesday and
Thursday mornings at seven o'clock, over the
Old Passage, through Chepstow, Monmouth,
Abergavenny, and Hereford, where it met the
Ludlow, Shrewsbury, Chester, and Holyhead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
coaches, and returned the following days, and
met the Bath, Warminster, Salisbury, and Southampton
coaches every Saturday, Tuesday, and
Thursday mornings at seven o'clock. "Performed
by W. Williams, Bennett, Whitney,
Broome, Young and Co."</p>

<p>"A new and elegant coach, called the 'Cornwallis,'"
left the Lamb Inn, Broadmead, every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon, at
two o'clock, through Newport, Gloucester, Tewkesbury
and Worcester, to the George and Rose Inn,
Birmingham, where it arrived early the next morning,
whence coaches set off for the Midlands,
North Wales, and the North of England. The
proprietors pledged themselves that no pains
should be spared to make this a favourite coach
with the public; and as one of the proprietors
would drive it a great part of the way, every attention
would be paid to the comfort of passengers.
The fares of this coach would at all times be as
cheap as any other coach on the road, and the
proprietors expected a preference no longer than
whilst endeavouring by attention to merit it.
"Performed by Thomas Brooks and Co., Bristol."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>March 10, 1804:&mdash;"The 'Cornwallis' coach to
Birmingham is to set out from the Swan Inn, Maryport
Street, at three every morning, Sundays
excepted, through Newport, Gloucester and
Worcester, and arrive at the Rose Inn, Birmingham,
early the same evening. The fares of this
coach and the carriage of goods will be found at
all times as cheap as any other coach on the road."
At this period Admiral Cornwallis, whose name
this coach bore, was fighting the French with his
fleet off Brest.</p>

<p>On August 19, in that year (1804), the public
were respectfully informed, that "a light four-inside
coach leaves the original Southampton
and general coach offices, Bush Inn and Tavern,
Bristol, every morning (Sundays excepted), at
seven o'clock precisely, and arrives at the Coach
and Horses Inn, Southampton, at five in the
afternoon. The Gosport coach, through Warminster,
Salisbury, Romsey and Southampton,
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings at
five o'clock. To Brighton, a four-inside coach in
two days, through Warminster, Salisbury, Romsey,
Southampton, Chichester, Arundel, Worthing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and Shoreham, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
mornings at seven, sleeps at Southampton, and
arrives early the following afternoon. Portsmouth
Royal Mail, through Warminster, Sarum,
Romsey, and Southampton every afternoon at
three o'clock. Also the Oxford Royal Mail,
every morning at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>On August 18, 1823, the state of the roads
comes under review:&mdash;"Mail men, who have to
drive rapidly over long distances, must ever be
on the look-out for the state in which the roads
are kept.</p>

<p>"In December, 1819, Mr. Johnson, Superintendent
of Mail Coaches, had to report to the
House of Commons on the 'petition of Mr.
McAdam,' who was engaged in constructing and
repairing of the public roads.</p>

<p>"Previous to this the roads were very bad in
most country places, except the mail coach roads,
built at the time the Romans came to England.</p>

<p>"McAdam's expenses up to 1814 amounted to
&pound;5,019 6s., actually expended by him up to
August, 1814, and he had travelled 30,000 miles
in 1,920 days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"He held the position of general surveyor of
the Bristol turnpike roads, at a salary, first year
&pound;400, and each subsequent year of &pound;500, but,
taking into account that the annual salary was
&pound;200 for expenses 'incident' to the office, the
remaining &pound;300 was not more than adequate
payment for the constant and laborious duties
attached to the situation."</p>

<p>Under date of November 8, 1823, there is a list
of Royal mails and post-coaches despatched from
and arriving at the Bush Tavern, Corn Street,
Bristol:&mdash;"London, daily, 4.0 p.m.; and at
reduced fares by the 'Regent' at 9.0 p.m.; Milford
and Waterford, via Cardiff and Swansea,
10.30 a.m. daily; Birmingham, Manchester and
Liverpool, every evening at 7.0; Oxford, daily,
at 7.0 a.m.; Portsmouth and Southampton,
every afternoon, at 4.0; Plymouth and Exeter,
every morning, at 8; Birmingham, Manchester
and Liverpool, daily, at 6.0 a.m.; Portsmouth
and Southampton, by the 'Rocket,' at 7.0 a.m.;
Gloster, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and
Holyhead leaves Bristol each day at 7.0 a.m."</p>

<p>On July 1, 1826, the "Hero" coach is quoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
as performing the journey from Bristol to Birmingham
in twelve hours.</p>

give to the inhabitants of that city two hours to

morning from London, Bristol, Birmingham, and
all parts of the North and West, and also from
Scotland and from all parts of the north of Ireland.
Should this object be attained, the intended new

<p>In 1830, the "Bull and Mouth" in St. Martin's-le-Grand
was a great coach rendezvous. A strong
and penetrating aroma of horses and straw pervaded
its neighbourhood, in Bull-and-Mouth
Street.</p>

<p>The Gloucester and Aberystwith mail-coach
continued to run until the year 1854, and it is
believed that was the last regular main road
mail-coach which was kept on the road. Its
guard from 1836 to its abolition in 1854 was
Moses James Nobbs.</p>

<p>The London mail coaches of the period loaded
up at about half-past seven at their respective
inns, and then assembled at the Post Office yard
in St. Martin's-le-Grand to receive the bags. All,
that is to say, except seven coaches carrying
West of England mails&mdash;the Bath, Bristol, Devonport,
Exeter, Gloucester, Southampton, and Stroud&mdash;which
started from Piccadilly.</p>

<p>A contemporary writer said:&mdash;"Wonderful
building, the new General Post Office, opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in 1829, nearly opposite. They say the Government
has got something very like a white elephant
in that vast pile. A great deal too big for present
needs, or, indeed, for any possible extension of
Post Office business."</p>

<p>And yet, in the 75 years which have elapsed two
other Post Offices of equal size have been built
near it, and acres of ground at Mount Pleasant&mdash;a
mile off&mdash;have been covered with buildings for
Post Office purposes!</p>

SOUTH COAST RAILWAY FROM BRISTOL, 1903.&mdash;THE
BRISTOL TO SALISBURY POST BOY HELD UP.&mdash;MAIL
COACH ACCIDENTS.&mdash;LUKE KENT AND RICHARD GRIFFITHS,
THE MAIL GUARDS.</p></div>


<p>In 1903, in connection with a projected new
railway from Bristol to Basingstoke the
promoters made a strong point of the fact that
the letters for the first delivery in the important
South Coast towns, such as Portsmouth and
Southampton, could not be posted quite so late
in Bristol then as could those which were carried
in the olden days by the mail coaches throughout.</p>

<p>A deputation, consisting of Mr. John Mardon,
Mr. Sidney Humphries, Mr. Bolt, and Mr. H.J.
Spear (Secretary), representing the Chamber of
Commerce and Shipping, waited on the Postmaster-General,
at the House of Commons, London,
respecting the imperfect service, and they did not
fail to point out to him (Mr. Austen Chamberlain)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the time-table of the old mail coach by way of
contrast with the present service by railway.</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain, replying to the
deputation, said that, as regarded the mail arrangements,
he thought he had no need to show
them that he recognised the importance of Bristol
as a great commercial centre, or how largely
recent developments had increased that importance.
He was also alive to the necessity of
prompt means of communication, but he was not
wholly his own master. They had complained
that the train service to the South and South-Eastern
Counties was very inconvenient. That,
unfortunately, was the only means of communication
upon which he had to rely. If they had
been able to put before him trains which he did
not use for the transmission of mails, he might
have been able to provide facilities. With the
existing train facilities the Post Office business
was conducted as well as it could be conducted.
That being so, there was no way by which he
could improve that service, except by requiring
of the companies concerned that they should
provide a special train for Post Office purposes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
He was afraid that trains run at the hours which
would be necessary to meet their wishes would
not secure much passenger traffic, and the whole
cost of the running would fall upon the Postmaster-General.
He would closely watch the
matter, and if he could see his way he would not
be reluctant to provide them with what they
desired. At present the service was the best in
his power to afford. They were probably aware
that the Post Office was experimenting in certain
places with motor-cars, and if they were found to
be reliable, that might be a way out of the difficulty.
He should keep that before him as a possibility,
if further railway facilities were not forthcoming.
He regretted that he could not make a more
hopeful statement. All he could say was that
he did not think the service was satisfactory for
a great commercial centre like Bristol, and if he
saw his way to provide them with something
better he would certainly not neglect to do so.</p>

<p>It may be opportune here to recall the mail
services of the past.</p>

<p>From an "Account of the Days and Hours of
the Post coming in and going out at Salisbury,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the following has been gleaned. The "Account"
is a broad sheet, and was printed in Salisbury in
1772 by Sully and Alexander. The name of
Daniel P. Safe, postmaster, is inscribed at the
foot of the "Account":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Comes in from Bristol through Bath, Bradford,
Trowbridge, Devizes, Westbury, Warminster,
Heytesbury, Wells, Shepton Mallet,

<p>The official bag seal of the
period was inscribed thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 10%;">
<img src="images/seal.jpg" width="100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Bristol and Portsmouth Mail Coach was
established under the immediate superintendence
of Francis Freeling, Secretary to the General Post
Office, who travelled on the coach on its first
journey about the year 1786.</p>

<p>In the year 1793 the Salisbury, Portsmouth,
and Chichester mails went out from Bristol
every morning at seven, and arrived in Bristol
every evening between nine and eleven. At
that period the coaches from Bristol for the
Southern Counties started thus:&mdash;Bush Tavern,
Corn Street, John Weeks; for Weymouth a post
coach every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
morning at 5; for Portsmouth a post coach every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday morning at
four, so that probably the mail which left at
7 a.m. daily was carried by mail cart and postboy.</p>

<p>In about the year 1798 a "long" coach set
out from Mr. Crosse's, the Crown Inn, Portsmouth,
to Southampton, Salisbury, Bath, and
Bristol, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
afternoon; and from Gosport every Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday, to the White Hart Inn,
Bristol.</p>

<p>The methods of service in 1798 and the perils
of the road are indicated by the following public
notice, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 32em;">"General Post Office,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 35em;">"October 11th, 1798.</span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The postboy carrying the mail from Bristol
to Salisbury on the 9th instant was stopped
between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock
at night by two men on foot within six miles of
Salisbury, who robbed him of seven shillings in
money, but did not offer to take the mail. Whoever
shall apprehend the culprit, or cause to be
apprehended and convicted both or either of the
persons who committed this robbery, will be
entitled to a reward of fifty pounds over and
above the reward given by Act of Parliament for
apprehending highwaymen. If either party will
surrender himself and discover his accomplice he
will be admitted as evidence for the Crown,
receive His Majesty's most gracious pardon, and
be entitled to the said reward.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no record that anyone claimed the
reward.</p>

<p>In 1828 the mail went out from Bristol at
twenty minutes past five o'clock for Salisbury,
Southampton, Portsmouth, and Chichester, and
arrived every day previously to the London mail&mdash;thus
Chichester, in Sussex, was linked up with
the Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Hampshire mails
at that early period. The charge for the postage
of a letter from Bristol to Portsmouth was at that
time ninepence.</p>

<p>Luke Kent was the first individual who filled
the place of Guard of the Chichester mail coaches.
At his death he left a sum of money, on the condition
of the Mail Guard always blowing the horn
when he passed the place of his interment, Farlington
Church, near Havant.</p>

<p>Prior to becoming a Mail Guard, Luke Kent
kept the turnpike gate at Post Bridge, and afterwards
became landlord of the Goat public house,
where he amassed a good fortune. He then
opened the Sadler's Wells and was assisted by
James Perry, the most celebrated mimic of his
time, who assumed the name of Rossignal. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was accustomed to procure a variety of birds,
and, having first given his excellent imitation of
the songs of each, to let them loose amongst the
audience, to their no small gratification. The
scheme failed.</p>

<p>In June, 1804, one of the Portsmouth night
coaches, having six inside and fifteen outside
passengers, besides a surplus of luggage, was
overturned near Godalming, Surrey. Twelve of the
passengers sustained considerable hurt, and nine
were obliged to be left behind; the lives of two
children were said to be despaired of. "We are
astonished at the temerity of the public in trusting
themselves to such vehicles."</p>

<p>A Time Bill of 1823, which gives details of a
Coach Service at that period, appears on page 83.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1826, a coachman on this road was accused
of imperilling his passengers through having
imbibed too freely, and the Mail Guard was
called on in the following letter to report on the
matter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"General Post Office, 29th July, 1826. Sir,&mdash;The
passengers who travelled with the Portsmouth
and Bristol mail on the 26th instant,
having complained that the coachman who drove
on that day from Bristol to Warminster was
drunk and unfit to drive I have to desire you
will explain the reason why you neglected to
report to me so great and so disgraceful an irregularity,
and also how it happened that you did not
know the coachman's name when the passengers
asked you for it. I am, sir, yours, etc.,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 30em;">C. Johnson.</span>&mdash;Mr. Folwell, Mail Guard, Bristol."<br />
</p>

<p>The explanation is not forthcoming.</p>

<p>In 1830, many of the public coaches started
from Portsmouth and passed through Portsea
and Landport, but&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"In olden time two days were spent<br />
'Twixt Portsmouth and the Monument;<br />
When flying Diligences plied,<br />
When men in Roundabouts would ride<br />
And, at the surly driver's will,<br />
Get out and climb each tedious hill.<br />
But since the rapid Freeling's age,<br />
How much improved the English stage,<br />
Now in eight hours with ease, the post<br />
Reaches from Newgate Street our coast."<br />
</div>

<p>In the years 1837 and 1838 the Portsmouth
mail coach was despatched at 7.5 p.m., from
Bristol Post Office&mdash;then located at the corner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Exchange Avenue. The posting of letters without
fee was allowed up to 6.35 p.m., and, with
fee, paid and unpaid letters alike up to 6.50
p.m. The coach started from the White Lion
coach office, Broad Street, at 6.45 p.m., so as to
be in readiness at the Post Office to take up the
mails at the appointed time. The arrival of the
mail at Portsmouth from Bristol was at 6.45
a.m. These times are an improvement upon
the service in operation in 1836. At that time
the coach left Bristol at 5.30 p.m., with a posting
up to 5.0 p.m. without fee, and with fees paid, up
to 5.15 p.m. On the inward journey the Coach
did not arrive until 8.9 a.m.</p>

<p>It will be appropriate here to enumerate certain
interesting incidents connected with the carrying
on of the Mail Coach system.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Jan. 5, 1805, the London Mail of
Friday se'nnight, had not arrived at Swansea
where it was due early in the morning, till eleven
o'clock that night, having been detained seventeen
hours at the New Passage, in consequence of
such large shoals of ice floating down the Severn
as to render it unsafe for the mail boat to cross
until Friday morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Thursday se'nnight, an inquest was held at
Swansea on the body of John Paul, driver of the
mail coach between that place and Caermarthen
which on Sunday was overturned about two miles
from Swansea, while proceeding with great
rapidity down a hill, it being supposed the coachman's
hands were so benumbed with cold that he
could not restrain the horses' speed, the consequence
of which was that he was so much
bruised as to occasion his death on Wednesday
night. The guard was slightly hurt, but the
passengers escaped uninjured. Verdict, accidental
death.</p>

<p>Very few details exist of that exceptional
season, in 1806, when Nevill, a guard on the
Bristol mail, was frozen to death; but the records
of the great snowstorm that began on the Christmas
night of 1836 are more copious.</p>

<p>A valuable reminiscence of that night&mdash;Dec. 27,
1836&mdash;is Pollard's graphic picture of the Devonport
mail snowed up at Amesbury. Six horses
could not move it, and Guard F. Feecham was
in parlous plight. Pollard's companion picture
of the Liverpool mail in the snow near St. Alban's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
on the same night is equally interesting. Guard
James Burdett fared little better than his comrade
on the Devonport mail:</p>

<p>"An accident occurred to the Worcester mail
Coach on Friday evening, March 27, 1829, opposite
the Bull and Mouth Office, in Piccadilly, which,
we are sorry to say, has proved fatal to Turner,
the coachman. Just as Turner had taken hold
of the reins, and while he was wrapping a large
coat over his knees, the leaders started, and,
turning sharply to the right, dashed one of the
fore-wheels against a post. The shock was so
violent that the coachman was flung from his
seat. He fell on his back, and his neck came
violently against the curb-stone. Not a moment
was lost in securing the assistance of a surgeon,
by whom he was bled. The poor man was shortly
removed to St. George's Hospital, where he died
at about eight o'clock on Saturday evening.
He left a wife and three infant children in a state
of destitution, without even the means of buying
a coffin."</p>

<p>As a "Caution to Mail Coachmen," the following
notice was issued on June 20, 1829:&mdash;"On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Friday, Thomas Moor, the driver of the London
mail from Bristol to Calne and back, appeared
before the Magistrates at Brislington to answer an
information laid against him by Mr. Bull, the
Inspector of Mail Coaches, by order of the G.P.O.
for giving up the reins to an outside passenger,
and permitting him to drive the mail, on May 29
last, from Keynsham to Bath, against the remonstrances
of the guard. The magistrates convicted
Moor in the mitigated penalty of &pound;5 and
11s. costs. Mr. Bull presented the Bath Hospital
with the amount of the fine."</p>

<p>On September 8th, 1837, a coachman named
Burnett was killed at Speenhamland, on the Bath
Road. He was driving one of the New Company's
London and Bristol stages, and alighted at the
"Hare and Hounds," very foolishly leaving the
horses unattended, with reins on their backs.
He had been a coachman for 20 years, but experience
had not been sufficient to prevent him
thus breaking one of the first rules of the profession.
He had no sooner entered the Inn than
the rival Old Company's coach came down the
road. Whether the other coachman gave the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
horses a touch with his whip as he passed, or if
they started of their own accord, is not known,
but they did start, and Burnett, rushing out to
stop them, was thrown down and trampled on,
so that he died.</p>

<p>There departed this life at Bristol, in November,
1904, a somewhat notable individual in the person
of Richard Griffiths, who was born at Westminster,
in the year 1811, and entered the service of
the Post Office as a Mail Guard on the 17th
November, 1834. At the commencement of
his service he was employed as Guard to the
London and Norwich, <i>via</i> Newmarket Mail Coach,
upon which duty he remained until the coach
ceased running on the 5th January, 1846, when
he was transferred to the London and Dover
Railway, and acted as Mail Train Guard thereon.
When a Travelling Post Office was established in
1860 on the Dover line of railway, and the necessity
for a Guard to the Mail bags thus removed,
Griffiths was ordered to the South Wales Railway,
where he remained as Mail Train Guard until
superannuated on the 25th August, 1870. He
lived at Eastville, in Bristol, under the care at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
last of Mrs. Barrett, a kind old dame, who made
him very comfortable, and on his demise, after
being on pension for 34 years, he bequeathed his
old battered Mail Coach horn to her (<i>see illustration</i>).
It is probable that the horn was used
on the last Norwich Coach out of London.
The maker's name on it is "J.A. Turner, 19
Poultry."</p>

<p>On November 9, 1822, attention was drawn to
the "Musical Coachman" thus:&mdash;"The blowing
of the horn by the coachman and guards of our
mail-coaches has usually been considered a sort
of nuisance: now, by the persevering labours of
these ingenious gentlemen, converted into an
instrument of public gratification. Most of the
guards of the stage-coaches now make their
entrance and exit to the tune of some old national
ballad, which, though it may not, perhaps, be
played at present in such exact time and tune as
would satisfy the leader of the opera band, is
yet pleasant in comparison to the unmeaning and
discordant strains which formerly issued from the
same quarter."</p>

<p>April, 1832:&mdash;"The Tipsy Member" finds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>mention thus: "An M.P. applied to the Post
Office to know why some of his franks had been

they were not your writing; the 'hand' is not
'the same.' 'Why, not precisely; but the
truth is I happened to be a <i>little tipsy</i> when I
wrote them.' 'Then, sir, you will be so good in
future as to write 'drunk' when you make
'free.'"</p>

<p>In this book are depicted an old State Coach,
the Mail Coach, the primitive Railway Train, and
a Railway Engine of the latest pattern, all
indicative of progress in locomotion. To complete
the series, and for the purpose of historical
record, subjoined is a picture of the first Motor
vehicle used (1904-1905) in Bristol for the rapid
transport of His Majesty's Mails by road. No
doubt, in process of time, this handy little 5-horse
power car, built to a Bristol Post Office design,
to carry loads of 3&frac12; cwt., and constructed by the
Avon Motor Company, Keynsham, near Bristol,
will have numerous fellow cars darting about in
the roads and crowded thoroughfares of Bristol
for the collection of letters and parcels in conjunc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>tion
with larger cars of higher horse power to
do the heavy station traffic and country road
work.</p>

<p>Still, little "Mercury" will have the credit of
being the pioneer car in the Bristol Post Office
Service. During its trials the car did really
useful service, and did not once break down.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE BUSH TAVERN, BRISTOL'S FAMOUS COACHING INN,
AND JOHN WEEKS, ITS WORTHY BONIFACE, 1775-1819.&mdash;THE
WHITE LION COACHING HOUSE, BRISTOL. ISAAC
NIBLETT.&mdash;THE WHITE HART, BATH.</p></div>


<p>It appears that John Weeks was landlord of
the Bush Tavern, Bristol, from 1775 to 1801,
and continued to be a coach proprietor until
1806. In the Eastern cloister of Bristol Cathedral
there is a mural tablet erected to his memory,
with a well-executed medallion portrait of him
in profile, with inscription as shown in the
illustration.</p>

<p>Verger Sproule, of old time, who was born in
the first year of the nineteenth century, once
told Mr. Morgan, present senior lay clerk, that
he well remembered John Weeks, and that the
portrait on the tablet was an excellent likeness
of him.</p>

<p>In "Mornings at Matlock," by Robey Skelton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Mackenzie, D.C.L., author of "Titian: an Art
Novel" (London, Henry Colburn, publisher,
1850), a book which contains a collection of
twenty-six short stories supposed to have been
told by people stopping at Matlock, there is an
interesting story relating to what was known as
the Bush Guinea. Briefly told, Dr. Mackenzie's
Bush Guinea story runs thus:&mdash;"It was the
delight of this Boniface (John Weeks) on every
Christmas Day, to cover the great table with a
glorious load of roast beef and plum pudding,
flanked most plenteously with double home-brewed
of such mighty strength and glorious
flavour that we might well have called it malt
wine rather than malt liquor. At this table on
that day every one who pleased was welcome to
sit down and feast. Many to whom a good
dinner was an object did so; and no nobler
sight was there in Bristol, amidst all its wealth
and hospitality, than that of honest John Weeks
at the head of his table, lustily carving and
pressing his guests to 'Eat, drink, and be merry.'
Nor did his generosity content itself with this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/illus-021.jpg" width="100%" alt="MURAL TABLET IN BRISTOL CATHEDRAL." title="" />
</div>
<p class="center"><b>MURAL TABLET IN BRISTOL CATHEDRAL.</b></p>

<p>"It was the custom of the house and of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>day, when the repast was ended, that each person
should go to honest John Weeks in the bar and
there receive his cordial wishes for many happy
returns of the genial season. They received
something more, for according to their several
necessities a small gift of money was pressed
upon each. To one man a crown; to another,
half-a-guinea; to a third, as more needing it a
guinea. On the whole some twenty or thirty
guineas were thus disbursed.</p>

<p>"On one particular year it had been noticed
during the months of November and December,
that a middle-aged man, whom no frequenter of
the Bush Inn appeared to know, and who
appeared to know no one, used to visit about
noon every day, and calling for a sixpenny glass
of brandy and water, sit over it until he had
carefully gone through the perusal of the London
paper of the previous evening. On Christmas
Eve, honest John Weeks, anxious that the
decayed gentleman should have one meal at
least in the 'Bush,' delicately hinted that on the
following day he kept open table. Punctually
at one o'clock, being the appointed hour, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
appeared at the Bush in his usual seedy attire.
John Weeks called his head waiter, a sagacious,
well-powdered, steady man, to whom he confidently
entrusted the donation which he had set
aside for the decayed gentleman. The decayed
gentleman quietly put it in his pocket, from
which he drew a card. The inscription on the
card was simply 'Thomas Coutts, 59, Strand.'
Amongst the heirlooms which she most particularly
prized, the late Duchess of St. Albans,
widow of Thomas Coutts, used to show a
coin richly mounted in a gorgeous bracelet,
which coin bore the name of 'The Bush
Guinea.'"</p>

<p>Numerous as the passengers were by the many
coaches starting from the Bush Inn, yet evidently
John Weeks was in the habit of finding enough
food for them to eat, and the wherewithal to
fortify themselves with, ere they set out on their
long coach journeys. The Bill of Fare for the
guests at that hostelry during the festive season
of 1790 shows that our ancestors had an excellent
conception of Christmas cheer. For variety and
quantity it could not easily be surpassed, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
these "degenerate" days could not even be
equalled. But let it speak for itself.</p>

<p>So far as can be ascertained, Matthew Stretch
kept the tavern from 1801 to 1805, and James
Anderson in 1805 and 1806. Mr. John Townsend
was "mine host" from 1807 until 1826.
Unfortunately, none of his descendants possess
a portrait of him. Mr. Charles Townsend, of
St. Mary's, Stoke Bishop, Bristol, has in his
possession the original lease, in which the Bush
Tavern in Corn Street was transferred, on the
18th December, 1806, from Mr. John Weeks,
wine merchant, on the one part, to Mr. John
Townsend on the other part, at a yearly rental
of &pound;395 of lawful money of the United Kingdom&mdash;the
term to be for fourteen years. The stables
and coach houses "of him, the said John
Weeks," situated in Wine Street, were included
in the transfer. Out of the rental the yearly
sum of &pound;20 had to be paid by the owner, John
Weeks, to the parish of St. Ewen, for that part of
the coffee house which stood in the said parish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>As showing how John Weeks safeguarded his
monopoly of coach-running to and from the
Bush Tavern, there was this stipulation in the
lease:&mdash;"The said John Townsend shall and
will from time to time and at all times during
the continuance of this demise take in and
receive at the said Tavern, hereby demised, all
and every Stage Coach or Public Carriage which
shall belong to the said John Weeks at any time
during this term, under the penalty of Two
thousand Pounds, and that he, the said John
Townsend, shall not nor will at any time during
the said Term, if the said John Weeks shall so
long run carriages of the aforesaid description,
take in at the said Tavern or Coffee Room any
Public Stage Coach or by way of evasion any
Public Carriage whatsoever used as a public
stage belonging to any person or persons whomsoever
without the consent and approbation of
the said John Weeks &amp;c. in writing for that
purpose first had and obtained under the
penalty of two thousand pounds to be paid for
any default in the observance and performance
of the covenants herein before contained in that
behalf."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>According to Paterson's "Roads," John
Weeks in 1794 occupied a homestead called
"The Rodney," at Filton Hay, 4 miles from
Bristol on the Bristol to Tewkesbury Road.</p>

<p>The following advertisement from a very old
newspaper will be interesting as indicative that in
addition to the John Weeks, of Bush Inn fame,
Bristol, there was at the Portsmouth end of the
Mail Coach route another worthy of the same
name, likewise engaged in the carrying trade, but
by sea instead of land:&mdash;"John Weeks, Master
of the Duke of Gloster Sloop, takes this method to
thank his friends and the public for their past
favours in the Southampton and Portsmouth
passage trade, and hopes for a continuance of the
same, as they may depend on his care, and the
time of sailing more regular than for many years
past. He sails from Southampton every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, and returns every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, wind and
weather permitting."</p>

<p>In the <i>Bristol Journal</i> of Saturday, July 28,
1804, "James Anderson (who kept the Lamb
Inn, Broadmead, eleven years), begged to inform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
his old friends and the public in general that he
has taken the Bush Inn, Tavern, and Coffee-house,
facing the Exchange, Bristol," where he
hoped, by constant attention, reasonable charges,
&amp;c., to render everything agreeable and convenient
to those who might kindly give a preference
to his house. There had evidently been
some friction at the Bush under the late management,
for Mr. Anderson also intimated that
"those gentlemen who withdrew from the Bush
Coffee-room (upon Huntley's leaving it) are
solicited to use it, gratis, until Christmas next."</p>

<p>In an advertisement following the above, John
Weeks solicited support to his new tenant at the
Bush, and added&mdash;"In the case of large dinners,
or other public occasions, John Weeks will assist
Mr. Anderson to give satisfaction."</p>

<p>On the site of the 'Bush,' the head offices of
the late West of England and South Wales District
Bank were erected. The directors of the Bristol
and West of England Bank purchased the premises
on December 31st, 1880. Lloyd's Bank
now stands on the site.</p>

<p>The White Lion, Bristol, was one of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
famous coaching houses in England, east, west,
north, or south. It stood in Broad Street, a
thoroughfare which belied its name as regards
breadth, and could only be considered broad by
comparison with the even narrower Small Street,
which ran parallel with it. Yet at one time
there were as many coaches passing in and out
of Broad Street as any street in Bristol, or even
in London!</p>

<p>That the White Lion had attained a venerable
age may be judged from the fact that it is mentioned
in a list of old Bristol inns and taverns,
published in 1606. On May 10, 1610, the Duke
of Brunswick visited Bristol, and took up his
quarters at this house. In 1621 the Earl of
Essex, and in more modern times, the Grand
Duke Constantine of Russia, lodged there. The
father of Sir Thomas Lawrence was host of the
White Lion before he removed to the Bear Inn,
Devizes. In 1684, it appears to have been
the occasional hostelry of a Duke of Beaufort,
for in that year, during Monmouth's rebellion,
His Grace of Badminton was in Bristol, where
he commanded several regiments of militia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
against the insurgents; and on that occasion
"the backward stables of the White Lion, in
Brode Street, were set on fire, and therein were
burnt to death two of the Duke of Beaufort's
best saddle horses. It was supposed to have
been done by the malice and envy of the fanaticks,
of whom a great many were sent prisoners
from Bristol to Gloucester, and there secured till
the rebellion was over."</p>

<p>In Matthew's "New History or Complete
Guide to Bristol" for the year 1793, there are
the following entries respecting this erstwhile
great coaching establishment:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Lion, Broad Street.</span>&mdash;Thomas Luce
proprietor. To London: A coach in two days
sets out on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays
at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Hart Inn, Broad Street.</span>&mdash;(The White
Hart adjoined the White Lion, and was a distinct
hostelry so far back as 1606.) George Poston.

at four o'clock. To Birmingham: A coach every
morning (Sundays excepted) at four o'clock, also
a mail coach every evening at seven o'clock. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Gloucester: A coach every morning at eight
o'clock. To Exeter: A coach every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday morning at six. To
Bath: A coach every morning at nine o'clock
and four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The <i>Bristol Mirror</i> made announcements touching
the White Lion thus:&mdash;"March 10, 1804.
Wonderful cheap travelling. Fare inside 10s. 6d.,
outside 8s. The public are respectfully informed
that coaches set out every Tuesday and Thursday
and Saturday morning from the White Lion and

<p>"April 12, 1832: New Royal Mail coach to
Bath daily at 7 a.m. Leaves York House, Bath,

Bristol, at 6.30 p.m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"April 21, 1832. Royal Mail to Liverpool

Street; arrive twelve noon the following day by

<p>Mr. Isaac Niblett, who became proprietor of the
White Lion Inn in 1823, in which year Thomas Luce
gave up the place, was a well-known individual
in the coaching world when the mail coach system
was at its zenith. He worked 600 coach and
post horses&mdash;a number only exceeded by the great
London coach proprietor Chaplin, with his 1,300,
and Horne and Sherman with their 700. Of the
twenty-two daily coaches between Bristol and
London the greater proportion made the White
Lion their headquarters. Amongst other coaches
with which Isaac Niblett was especially associated
were the "Red Rover" and the "Exquisite."
The "Red Rover" ran from Bristol to Brighton
through Bath, over Salisbury Plain, on to Southampton
and Chichester, and covered the distance
of 140 miles in fourteen hours. The "Exquisite"
used to run from Birmingham to Cheltenham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
thence on through Bristol to Exeter. In the
<i>Bristol Directory and Gazette</i> of 1859, Mr. Niblett's
innkeepership is alluded to thus:&mdash;"Isaac Niblett,
White Lion and British Coffee House, family
commercial and posting house; hearse and
mourning coach proprietor." The White Hart,
family and commercial hotel, Broad Street, was
at that time kept by one Charles Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. Isaac Niblett, like John Weeks, of Bush
Inn fame, had a country place near Bristol. He
owned, and stayed from time to time at the
Conigre House, Fylton. Mr. Niblett was for some
time the owner of the old Bush Inn stables in
Dolphin Street, according to evidence given in a
recent trial before the Judge of Assize at Bristol.
That site, as well as the Conigre Farm, Fylton,
is, it is believed, still in the possession of his lineal
descendants.</p>

<p>The Grand Hotel, one of the largest in the West
of England, and most central in the city of Bristol,
now stands on the sites of both the White Lion
and the White Hart Hotels. Erected in 1869, it
was known as the new White Lion until 1874,
when its name was changed to that of the Grand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>Hotel. The accompanying illustration of the
White Lion and the White Hart Inns, taken from
a lithograph engraving of about 1880 by the
well-known Bristol firm of lithographers, Messrs.
Lavars, must have been copied from a picture
produced subsequent to the old coaching days,
and, judging from the costumes of the pedestrians
depicted, the period was probably about 1860, or
a few years before the demolition of the old inns.
The figure of a white hart appears in the
picture over the entrance door of that hostelry
but the statue of a white lion, which for very
many years stood over the entrance gateway to
the inn of that name, and which is recollected by
many persons still living, was for some reason or
other omitted from the engraving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/illus-022.jpg" width="100%" alt="THE OLD WHITE LION COACHING INN, BROAD STREET, BRISTOL." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE OLD WHITE LION COACHING INN, BROAD STREET, BRISTOL.</span>
</div>

<p>The White Lion appears to have been the leading
Inn in the town in 1824, for on May 12 in
that year the Mayor, Corporation, and leading
citizens dined there on the occasion of the laying
of the foundation stone of the Bristol Council
House. Samuel Taylor Coleridge delivered lectures
in the large room of the Inn in 1800. It
was the "blue" house, and in later times the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
coach which most frequently entered its narrow
archway was driven by his Grace the sixth Duke
of Beaufort, who put up at the inn on his visits
to Bristol, as he had, it is said, a great respect for
Isaac Niblett's sterling qualities and fine sporting
instincts.</p>

<p>What an evolution in pleasure and commercial
traffic has come about in the last three-quarters of a
century! When the White Lion in Broad Street and
the Bush Tavern in Corn Street were in their prime
as Coaching Inns, a four-in-hand Coach in Bristol's
narrow streets and on the neighbouring country
roads was so often in evidence as scarcely to
induce the pedestrian even to turn his head round
to look at one in passing. Now such a patrician
vehicle in Bristol's midst is brought down to an
unit, and it is left to Mr. Stanley White, son of
Sir George White, Bart., with his well-appointed
Coach and his team of bright chestnuts, to link old
Bristol with the traditions of past Coaching days.
Strange that Mr. Stanley White should have
blended in his one person the love of a coachman
for a team with the will and nerve to render him
one of Bristol's boldest and most expert drivers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the road machine of the latest kind, to wit: the
Motor Car.</p>

<p>At a function in Bath in 1902, described in these
pages, Colonel Palmer, a descendant of John Palmer,
presented a small curiosity to the Corporation.
Readers of Pickwick will remember that, when
Mr. Pickwick was proceeding to Bath, Sam Weller
discovered inside the coach the name of "Moses
Pickwick," and wanted to fight the guard for
what he considered an outrage on his master.
Among John Palmer's papers was an old contract
for the Bristol and Bath Mail Service, and one of
the parties bore the name of Pickwick, and was
the landlord of the White Hart Hotel at Bath.
It was that contract which Colonel Palmer presented
to the Corporation, as a memorial both of
his grandfather and of Dickens.</p>

<p class="center">TOLL GATES AND GATE-KEEPERS.</p>


<p>As this book is devoted in great measure to
the mail services of old time&mdash;which had to
be carried on entirely by horse and rider or
driver&mdash;allusion may fittingly be made to the
toll gate system, which played its part in
connection with mail vehicular transport.</p>

<p>Toll bars originated, it seems, so far back as
the year 1267. They were at first placed on the
outskirts of cities and market towns, and afterwards
extended to the country generally. The
tolls for coaches and postchaises on a long
journey were rather heavy, as the toll bars were
put up at no great distances from each other.
In the year 1766, Turnpike Trusts, taking advantage
of Sabbatarian feeling, charged double
rates on Sundays, but experienced travellers
sometimes journeyed on that day, and submitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>to the double impost, to gain the advantage of
avoiding highwaymen, who did not carry on
their avocation on Sunday, but gave themselves
up to riot, conviviality, or repose.</p>

<p>Coaches which carried H. Majesty's mails were
exempted by Act of Parliament from paying
tolls. The exemption of mail coaches from
paying tolls, a relief provided by the Act of 25th
George III., was really a continuation of the
old policy, by which the postboys of an earlier
age, riding on horseback, and carrying the mails
on the pommel of the saddle, had always been
exempt from toll, and the light mail carts of a
later age were always exempted.</p>

<p>It was no great matter, one way or the
other, with the Turnpike Trusts, Mr. C.G.
Harper tells us in "The Mail and Stage Coach,"
for the posts were then few and far between,
and the revenue almost nil; but the advent
of numerous mail coaches, running constantly
and carrying passengers, and yet contributing
nothing to the maintenance of the roads,
soon became a very real grievance to those
Trusts situated on the route of the mails. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
1816 the various Turnpike Trusts approached
Parliament for a redress of these disabilities.</p>

<p>Mail coaches continued, however, to go free
until the end of the system, although from 1798
they had to pay toll in Ireland. In Scotland
in 1813 an Act was passed repealing the exemption
in that part of the kingdom. Pack horses
were superseded by huge wagons on the busiest
roads early in the eighteenth century. Over
5,000 Turnpike Acts for the improvement of
local roads were passed during the years 1700
and 1770. At the latter part of this period,
narrow wheels were penalised more heavily
than broad wheels.</p>

<p>Lewis Levy was a prominent man in the days
of Turnpike Trusts, as he was a farmer of
Metropolitan turnpike tolls to the tune of half
a million pounds a year!</p>

<p>The history of toll bars is not wanting in
romance: "Blow up for the gate," would say
the coachman to the guard, when drawing near to
a "pike" in the darkness of night. Lustily might
guard blow, but it did not always have the
desired effect. "Gate, gate!" would shout
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>coachman and guard. Down would get guard
and tootle-tootle impatiently. And out would
shuffle in his loose slippers the "pike" keeper
in a dazed condition from fatigue produced by
frequent disturbances. As he opens the gate
he is soundly rated by coachman and guard,
and enjoined to leave the gate open for the next
mail down, or he would have to pay a fine of 40s.
to the Postmaster General, that being the penalty
for not preserving an unobstructed way for
H. Majesty's mails.</p>

<p>In the Bristol district toll bars were plentiful,
and attempts were made to erect ornate little
houses which should be pleasing to the eyes of
travellers. That such attempts were not always
unsuccessful, the picturesque toll-gate houses
depicted in these pages will demonstrate.</p>

<p>In 1804, Sarah Rennison, widow of Thomas
Rennison, advertised that she lately had the
ladies' and gentlemen's cold baths, near Stokes
Croft Turnpike, effectually cleaned. "These
baths are supplied with water from a clear and
ever-flowing spring, uncontaminated by anything
whatever, as it flows from a clear and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
limpid stream from its source to the pipes in
the baths."</p>

<p>This turnpike, named the Stokes Croft Gate,
stood on the turnpike way designated Horfield
Road. The gate was erected across the lane
leading from the said road to Rennison's Baths.</p>

<p>Very soon after "Sarah's" announcement,
this landmark of the old city was doomed to
disappear, and the gate was removed from the
top of the Croft to a site some four or five hundred
yards further up the road, near to the present
railway arch.</p>

<p>An advertisement from the <i>Bristol Journal</i>,
Saturday, July 14th, 1804, ran as follows:&mdash;"To
be sold, the materials of the old Turnpike House
at the top of Stoke's Croft. The purchaser to
be at the expense of pulling down and carrying
the same away. Also of pitching the site of the
house by the 20th of August next. For further
particulars apply to Messrs. John and Jere
Osborne."</p>

<p>The tolls for the year ended the 29th September,
1823, realised the sum of &pound;1,800. The
notice respecting the letting of the tolls for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>

<p>The other Bristol "Gates" were known as
Clifton, Redland, White Ladies, Horfield, St.
Michael's Hill, Cutler's Mills, Gallows Acre,
Barrow's Lane, Stapleton Bridge, Pack Horse
Lane, Fire-Engine Lane, George's Lane, West
Street, Cherry Garden, Fire-Engine, Blackbirds,
one full toll in each case.</p>

<p>Thomas Brooks was the last toll-keeper at
St. Michael's Hill, Bristol. He held the office
until it was abolished in 1867. In the following
year he was appointed sub-postmaster of Cotham,
and removed from the old Toll House to a house
nearer the city. The Toll House stood at the
corner of Hampton Road and Cotham Hill,
where the fountain is now.</p>

<p>Benjamin Gray, the last keeper of the "Stop
Gate" which stood near the Royal Oak Inn at
Horfield, held the office for 30 years. The gate
was to stop travellers entering the city by way of
Ashley Down Road, and thus escape paying the
tolls at the Zetland Road end of Gloucester
Road. There is a family connection between
the Gray and the Brooks families, and the
daughter of Benjamin now resides with Samuel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Brooks, the old sexton of Horfield Church. A
model of the Horfield Stop Gate may be seen at
Robin Hood's Retreat near Berkeley Road,
Bristol.</p>

<p>The last barrier on the great London to
Bristol Road was removed when the bridge
crossing the Thames at Maidenhead was freed
from toll at midnight, on November 30th, 1903.
There was a remarkable demonstration on the
occasion. Five hundred people waded through
the flooded streets to see the toll-gate removed
from the bridge which was erected so far back
as in 1772.</p>

<p>Precisely at twelve by the toll-house clock
Corporation employ&eacute;s proceeded to remove the
gate, amid loud cheering. Many of the crowd
closed in, and finally seizing the huge gate,
carried it to the top of Maidenhead Bridge and
threw it into the river.</p>

1726-1781.&mdash;BILL NASH, MAIL COACH ROBBER,
CONVICT AND RICH COLONIST, 1832.&mdash;BURGLARIES AT POST
OFFICES IN LONDON AND BRISTOL, 1881-1901.</p></div>


<p>The mail services between Bristol and the
Southern Counties came into great prominence
in 1903. The Postmaster-General was
appealed to on the subject, and the phantom of
the old Bristol and Portsmouth mail coach was
conjured up to form a comparison detrimental to
present-day arrangements. The discussion recalls
somewhat vividly the mail coach traditions of the
pre-railway period, and certainly the community
of to-day has, at all events, fallen on better times
as regards security of the mails, if not better night
mail services. In the General Post Office letter
in Lombard Street, 26th April, 1720, this note
appears:&mdash;"The Bristol Mail was again robbed
yesterday, in the same place as on Friday, by one
highwayman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mist's Journal</i> of Apl. 30, 1720, states:&mdash;"Last
week the Oxford Stage Coach was robbed between
Uxbridge and London, by the same highwaymen
as is supposed who robbed the Bristol Mail, one
of them having a scar on his forehead."</p>

<p>"A man lately taken up near Maidenhead
Thicket, and charged with robbing the Cirencester
Stage Coach, has been examined by a Justice of
the Peace, who has committed him to Reading
Gaol. He is said to be a butcher's son of Thame,
in Oxfordshire."</p>

<p>The following particulars relate to a Bristol
mail coach robbery in 1721. They were taken
from a pamphlet written by Wilson, who was one
of the highwaymen therein alluded to, and saved
his neck by informing. Wilson was a person of
education, but some of his statements were
questionable. The pamphlet was full of moral
reflections upon the evils of bad company,
gambling, &amp;c.; it ran through several editions,
so it was no doubt popular. It will be interesting
as indicating the difficulties attending the Bristol
mail services of the period, and that death was
the penalty for robbing his Majesty's mails. It
runs thus in the heading:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"A full and impartial account of all the
robberies committed by John Hawkins, George
Sympson (lately executed for robbing the Bristol
mails), and their companions. Written by
Ralph Wilson, late one of their confederates.
London: Printed for J. Poole at the Lockes
Head in Paternoster Row. Price 6d."</p>

<p>The following is an abbreviation of the contents
so far as they relate to the Bristol mails:&mdash;</p>

<p>John Hawkins was the son of poor but honest
parents. His father was a farmer, and lived at
Staines, Middlesex. Had a slender education.
At 14 he waited on a gentleman, then was a
tapster's boy at the Red Lion, at Brentford;
got into service again, was butler to Sir Dennis
Daltry; took to gambling; was suspected of
being a confederate in robbing his master's house
of plate; was dismissed. At the age of 24 took
to highway robbery; stopped a coach on Hounslow
Heath, and eased the passengers of about &pound;11;
with others committed several robberies on
Bagshot and Hounslow Heaths; was arrested
for attempting to rescue Captain Lennard, one of
his accomplices, but was discharged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson, the writer of the pamphlet, was a
Yorkshireman; became clerk to a Chancery
barrister; met Hawkins at a gambling-house;
they became "great cronies." Wilson joins
Hawkins's gang; they commit several highway
robberies. Feb. 1, 1721, Wilson goes to Yorkshire;
Hawkins impeached several of his companions,
and one of them (Wright) was hanged.
Hawkins, Wilson, and others robbed one morning
the Cirencester, the Worcester, the Gloster, the
Oxford, and the Bristol stage coaches; the next
morning the Ipswich and Colchester coaches; a
third morning, perhaps the Portsmouth. The
Bury coach was "our constant customer."</p>

<p>Sympson, who was born at Putney, and had no
education, had by this time joined the gang.
The robberies were continued. In April (1722)
they went back to their old design of robbing
the mail coaches. They first proposed to rob the
Harwich mail, but gave up that design because
that mail was "as uncertain as the wind." They
then decided to rob the Bristol mail. Wilson
said he objected to this plan, but he joined in
it. They set out Sunday, April 15th. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
next morning being Monday, we took the mail,
and again on Wednesday morning. The meaning
of taking it twice was to get the halves of
some bank bills, the first halves whereof we took
out of the mail on Monday morning." On
Monday, April 23rd, Wilson learnt at the Moorgate
Coffee House that there was a great request
for the robbers of the Bristol mail. He therefore
contemplated taking a passage to Newcastle,
but before he could do so he was arrested, and
carried to the General Post Office, where he was
examined by the Postmaster-General. He was
again examined by the Postmaster-General
(Carteret) the next morning, but he denied all
knowledge of the robbery. While under examination,
a messenger came from Hawkins, who was
in prison at the Gate House, "to let the Post-house
know that he had impeached me." One
of the officers of the Post Office then showed
Wilson an unsigned letter, which he recognised
as being in Sympson's handwriting, confessing
his share in the robbery, and offering to secure
his two companions. Wilson then decided to
confess. Hawkins and Sympson were tried,
found guilty, and executed 21st May, 1722.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with this Bristol mail robbery,
the following are interesting particulars from the
calendar of Treasury papers:&mdash;"Memorial of
William Saunderson, clerk, to Sir Robert Walpole.
Says he was author of an expedient to prevent
the Bristol and other mails from being robbed.
The scheme seems to have been to write with red
ink on the foreside of all bank notes the name of
the post town where they were posted, the day of
the month, and also the addition of these words,
viz.:&mdash;'From Bristol to London,' &amp;c. These
services (presumably Saunderson's) have been
attended with great expense and loss of time,
and no mail robberies have since been committed.
Asks for compensation. Referred 11th April,
1728, to postmasters to report. May 23, 1728.&mdash;Affidavit
of W. Saunderson, receiver, of Holford,
West Somerset (probably the same person), that
he sent a letter subscribed A.Z. to the Postmaster-General
offering an expedient to prevent the
robbing of the Bristol and other mails, and of the
subsequent negotiations with the Post Office;
has never received any reward. Mr. Carteret
claimed the contrivance of the scheme wholly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
himself. May 29th.&mdash;Postmaster-General's report
of 17th April read: 'My Lords satisfied
with the report.' Saunderson had no pretence
to any reward. Scheme entirely formed at Post
Office without assistance of Saunderson or anybody
else. Saunderson called in, informed that
my Lords adhere to Postmaster-General's report,
and nothing more will be ordered therein."</p>

<p>Stealing a letter or robbing the mail was a
capital offence long after Hawkins and Sympson
expiated their offences on the scaffold. Thus a
notice from the General Post Office on the 24th
July, 1767, issued in the <i>London Evening Post</i>,
dated "From Tuesday, July 28th, to Thursday,
July 30th, 1767," recited that&mdash;"Notice is
hereby given that by an Act passed the last
Session of Parliament, 'For amending certain
Laws relating to the revenue of the Post
Office, and for granting rates of postage for
the conveyance of letters and packets between
Great Britain and the Isle of Man, and within
that Island,' it is enacted&mdash;That from and after
the first day of November, 1767, if any person
employed or afterwards to be employed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Post Office shall 'secrete, embezzle, or destroy
any letters, &amp;c.,' 'every such offender, being
thereof convicted, shall be deemed guilty of
felony and shall suffer death as a felon, without
benefit of clergy.' Also if any person or persons
whatsoever shall rob any mail or mails, in which
letters are sent or conveyed by post, although
it shall not prove to be highway robbery or robbery
committed in a dwelling-house, yet such
offender or offenders shall be 'deemed guilty of
felony, and shall suffer death as a felon, without
benefit of clergy.'" In 1781 there was another
robbery of the Bristol mail. The occurrence
was set forth in detail in the following notice,
which was issued on January 29th in that
year:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"General Post Office, Jan. 29, 1781.
</p>

<p>"The Postboy bringing the Bristol Mail this
morning from Maidenhead was stop't between
two and three o'clock by a single Highwayman
with a crape over his face, between the 11th and
12th milestones, near the Cranford Bridge, who
presented a pistol to him, and after making him
alight, drove away the Horse and Cart, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>were found about 7 o'clock this morning in a
meadow field near Farmer Lott's at Twyford,
when it appears that the greatest part of the
letters were taken out of the Bath and Bristol
Bags, and that the following bags were entirely
taken away:&mdash;Pewsey, Ramsbury, Bradford,
Henley, Cirencester, Gloucester, Ross, Presteign,
Fairford, Aberystwith, Carmarthen, Pembroke,
Calne, Trowbridge, Wallingford, Reading, Stroud,
Ledbury, Hereford, Northleach, Lechlade, Lampeter,
Tenby, Abergavenny, Newbury, Melksham,
Maidenhead, Wantage, Wotton-under-Edge,
Tewkesbury, Leominster, Cheltenham, Hay, Cardigan,
Haverfordwest.</p>

<p>"The person who committed this robbery is
supposed to have had an accomplice, as two
persons passed the Postboy on Cranford Bridge
on Horseback, prior to the Robbery, one of whom
he thinks was the robber; but it being so
extremely dark, he is not able to give any description
of their persons.</p>

<p>"Whoever shall apprehend and convict, or
cause to be apprehended and convicted, the
person who committed this Robbery, will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>entitled to a reward of Two Hundred Pounds,
over and above the Reward given by Act of
Parliament for apprehending Highwaymen; or
if any person, whether an Accomplice in the
Robbery or knoweth thereof, shall make Discovery
whereby the Person who committed the
same may be apprehended and brought to Justice,
such Discoverer will upon conviction of
the party be entitled to the Same Reward of
Two Hundred Pounds, and will also receive his
Majesty's most gracious Pardon.</p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 28em;">"ANTH. TODD, Sec."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The robbery, which was graphically described
by Mr. G. Hendy, of St. Martin's-le-Grand, in
the 1901 Christmas Number of "The Road,"
does not appear to have been a very daring one
as regards the act itself, but it was so as to its
consequences. There was no mail coach&mdash;no
driver in scarlet&mdash;no mail guard&mdash;no passengers,
but only a ramshackle iron mail cart&mdash;a "postboy"
as driver and carrying no arms. What a
contrast is this old mail cart with a single horse,
carrying the mails for all the places enumerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in the Notice, to the splendidly appointed four-horse
mail coaches of a period thirty years later
on, or to the present time, when on the Great
Western Railway one whole train is used to carry
only a moiety of the King's mail to Bristol and
the West! No wonder that the postboy fell an
easy victim to the highwaymen, who bound him
and threw him into an out-of-the-way field.
The desperadoes proved to be two brothers,
young men of the name of Weston.</p>

<p>The Westons, after the robbery, went up and
down the country on the North road very rapidly,
in order to get rid of the &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000
worth of bank notes and bills which they plundered
from the mails. The Bow Street runners
were on their track from the first, and the chase
continued from London to Carlisle and back.
The vagabonds were not, however, captured, and
the notice was exhibited all over the country,
with the addition of the description of the men
wanted by the thief-catchers.</p>

<p>In 1782, the brothers were tried for another
offence and acquitted, but they were arrested at
once for the robbery of the Bristol mail and com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>mitted
to Newgate. On trial they were found
guilty, and paid the penalty of death by hanging
at Tyburn, on the 3rd September, 1782. In
later years the death penalty for robbing mails
was abolished, and at least one old sinner who
robbed the Bristol mail eventually did remarkably
well through having committed that dire
offence against the laws, and by having been
transported to the Antipodes at his country's
expense.</p>

<p>Particulars of his career have been furnished
by Mr. R.C. Newick, of Cloudshill, St. George,
Bristol, by means of the following extract from
a work published in 1853, "Adventures in Australia,
'52-'53," by the Rev. Berkeley Jones, M.A.,
late curate of Belgrave Chapel (Bentley, London,
1853):&mdash;"If you turn into any of the auction
rooms in Sydney the day after the gold escort
comes in you may see and, if you can, buy, pretty
yellow-looking lumps from about the size of a
pin's head to a horse bean, or, if you prefer it, a
flat piece about the size of a small dessert plate.
One of the greatest buyers is an old pardoned
convict of the name of 'William,' or, as he is there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
more commonly called, 'Bill' Nash, who robbed
the Bristol mail, of which he was the guard.
His wife followed him&mdash;as some say, with the
booty&mdash;and set up a fine shop in Pitt Street in
the haberdashery line. Under the old system he
was assigned to her as a servant. Her own
husband her domestic! What a burlesque on
transportation as a punishment! He is very
unpopular with the old hands, as he returned to
England and offered an intentional affront to
Queen Victoria when driving in the Park, by
drawing his horses across the road as her equipage
was driving by. He cut a great dash in the
Regent's Park, and was known as the 'flash
returned convict.' We stood by him at Messrs.
Cohen's auction room when the gold fraud
(planting on the gold buyers nuggets made in
Birmingham) was discussed. He addressed us,
and we cannot add that he prepossessed us much
in his favour. He looks what he is and has been.
In a little cupboard-looking shop in King Street
he may be seen in shirt sleeves spreading a tray
full of sovereigns in the shop front and heaping up
bank-notes as a border to them, inviting anyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to sell their gold to him. We believe he is now
among the wealthiest men of New South Wales."</p>

<p>By the year 1830 the terror inspired by highwaymen
had no doubt diminished, but the coach
proprietors thought it prudent to guard themselves
against loss, and so they put increased
charges on the articles of value they had to carry.
On the 1st September, 1830, a coaching notice
of about 1,000 words, based on an Act of Parliament,
was put forth by Moses Pickwick and Company
from the White Hart, Bath. A copy of
this notice on a large screen was exhibited
recently at the Dickens celebration at Bath.
The notice, in legal or other jargon, announced
the increased rate of charge for commission by
mail or stage coach of articles of value. Put
into plain form, the increased rates of charge
were as follows, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;Additional charge for
parcel or package over &pound;10 in value.&mdash;For every
pound, or for the value of every pound, contained
in such parcel or package over and above the
ordinary rate of carriage, not exceeding 100 miles,
1d.; 100 to 150 miles, 1&frac12;d.; 150 to 200 miles,
2d.; 200 to 250 miles, 2&frac12;d.; exceeding 250
miles, 3d.</p>

<p>Few people now bear in mind the great robbery
of registered letters from the Hatton Garden
Branch Post Office, London, in November, 1881,
which was effected with skill and daring, and yet
with simplicity as to method. At 5.0 p.m. on
the eventful day the members of the staff were
busily engaged, when, lo! the gas suddenly
went out, and the office, which was full of people
at the time, was left in darkness. The lady
supervisor obtained matches, went to the basement
and there found that the gas had been turned
off at the meter. When the gas had been turned
on again and lighted, it was discovered that the
registered letter bag, which had already been
made up and was awaiting the call of the collecting
postman, was missing. The bag contained
40 registered letters, and their value was
estimated at from &pound;80,000 to &pound;100,000. In the
many years which have elapsed since the great
robbery no clue to the perpetrators of the daring
deed has been discovered. No further attempts
at such robberies took place for some time, but
in the year 1888 several daring burglaries took
place at post offices in London. The Smithfield<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Branch Post Office was the first broken into, the
thieves staying in the office from Saturday night
to Sunday night. During that interval they
removed the safe from under the counter, placed
it in the Chief Officer's enclosure, broke it open
and rifled the contents. Cash and stamps to the
value of about &pound;180 were stolen. In the autumn
of the same year the Aldgate B.O. was burgled&mdash;a
Saturday night being chosen for the exploit.
The manner in which the burglary was effected
leaves little doubt that the depredation was
committed by the same gang of thieves. The
safe was broken open, but in this case it was
left under the counter, where it stood, and was
there rifled of its contents. The interior of the
office, including a part of the counter under
which the safe stood, was fully visible from the
outside, the woodwork in front of the office having
been kept low for the purpose, and it was marvellous
that the thieves were not detected, as a
poor woman had just been murdered by
"Jack the Ripper" within 200 yards, and the
road in front of the post office was thronged
with excited people. The thieves in this case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
got off with cash and stamps to the value of
&pound;328.</p>

<p>Later in the same year, the South Kensington
Branch Post Office was entered by burglars under
precisely similar circumstances. The thieves
only obtained the small sum of &pound;6, as, being
disturbed, they decamped in haste, leaving
behind them their tools and certain articles of
clothing. They had removed the safe, weighing
1&frac12; cwt., from the public office without being
observed, although it was taken from a spot
immediately in front of a large window, through
which police and passers-by could command
full view of the office. The Westbourne Grove
and Peckham Branch Post Offices were also
burglariously entered in the same year. Although
the burglars were not discovered in connection
with these post office robberies, and none more
daring of their kind have occurred since, they
probably were imprisoned for some other misdemeanour.
Was it&mdash;it may well be asked&mdash;this
same gang of burglars released from durance vile
who committed the post office robbery which in
1901 took place at Westbury-on-Trym, a suburb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of Bristol, three miles distant from the city?
For daring it might well have been they, as
the following account will demonstrate.</p>

<p>The post office, be it said, was in the middle of
the village and within 200 yards of the Gloucestershire
Constabulary Dep&ocirc;t, and actually within
sight of it. It was during the early hours of the
morning of the 18th October that the burglary
took place. Not far from the post office building
operations were being carried on, and from the
houses in course of erection the thieves obtained
a ladder and a wheelbarrow. Making their way
to the side of the premises, one member of the
gang, by means of the borrowed ladder effected
an entrance through the fanlight over the postmen's
room door, and marks of damp stockinged
feet revealed the fact that they crept through a
sliding window into the post office counter room,
where the safe was located. The street door
was then opened to their confederates, and the
safe, weighing nearly 2 cwt., was carried to the
barrow outside. The thieves retired to a partially
completed dwelling for the purpose of examining
the contents of the safe. They broke open the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
carpenter's locker, and many tools were subsequently
found on the floor. These evidently
had not assisted the gang to any great extent,
as they found it necessary to use a heavy pickaxe.
The noise they made seems to have
aroused the inmates of the neighbouring houses,
and it is said that one resident struck a light
and actually saw them at work, but he concluded
that they were merely doing something
in connection with the extensive drainage
alterations which had been in progress for many
months. This light apparently disturbed the
thieves, for they departed with their burden
and the pickaxe and retraced their steps. Close
to the Parish Institute they managed, in spite
of the darkness, to discover a gap in the hedge,
and having forced the wheelbarrow through
this, they left unmistakable traces of the route
taken across the adjoining field.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/illus-032.jpg" width="100%" alt="THE OLD POST OFFICE, WESTBURY-ON-TRYM." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE OLD POST OFFICE, WESTBURY-ON-TRYM.</span>
</div>

<p>Having wheeled the safe some 300 or 400 yards,
and some 50 yards beyond the cottages in Canford
Lane, they again brought the pickaxe into
requisition, and some hours later a workman
discovered the safe, with one end broken into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
dozens of pieces, lying near the hedge. He at
once gave information to the police. It was
afterwards found that, although the thieves had
removed the paper money from the safe, they
had thrown the postal orders, money order
forms, stamps, licenses, etc., into a neighbouring
field, where they were found strewn about in
great disorder. The safe contained postal orders
stamps, postcards, and cash of the total value of
&pound;315. Cash to the value of &pound;25 was the extent
of the thieves' booty, and they left behind them
three &pound;5 notes, half a sovereign, and two sixpences,
which were found on the grass. As all
the articles were dry, it was apparent that the
robbery took place after 2 a.m., up to which
time there had been rain. The officials at the
office had begun their morning's work quite unconscious
of what had happened, when Police
Sergeant Greenslade appeared with the handle
of the safe. The fact of the officials not having
been disturbed may be accounted for by the
circumstance that blasting operations had been
carried on at night in the immediate neighbourhood
for some twelve months before. The sub-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>postmistress
and her family, it appeared, did not
retire to rest until very near midnight, and it is
supposed that they were in their first heavy
sleep, but it is a mystery why the dog, a sharp
fox terrier, remained quiet.</p>

<p>The safe was kept in a prominent position in
the shop&mdash;two people slept just over it&mdash;and the
exterior of the shop was well lighted at night by a
large public lamp. Sleeping in the house were
several females and males, one of the latter being
an ex-Sergeant-Major of Dragoons, 6 feet 2 inches
in height and of great bodily strength. Next
door lived a baker whose workman is about
early in the morning, so it may be inferred that
the burglars had no small amount of nerve.
Within a week another robbery took place at a
mansion within a mile of the post office. This
occurred in the evening. Whether or not this
second burglary was the work of the same gang
which carried off the post office safe, there is
similar evidence of most carefully laid plans and
of intimate acquaintance with the house and the
habits of its occupants.</p>

<p>Ere the excitement of these two burglaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
had passed off as a nine days' wonder, another
robbery equally bold in character took place,
and this time in the very centre of the city of
Bristol, and in its most frequented thoroughfare.
A jeweller's shop window was rifled at 6.0 a.m.,
at a time when the police were being relieved.
The thieves got off with about &pound;2,000 worth of
rings, etc. These three burglaries in conjunction
seem to indicate the work of one gang of professional
burglars hailing probably from the
Metropolis.</p>

<p>A little time later, a post office safe in the West
End of London was rifled, the burglars discarding
old methods of violence in breaking it open, and
using a jet of oxyhydrogen flame to burn away
a portion of the safe door!</p>

RAIL&mdash;THE WESTERN RAILROAD.&mdash;POST OFFICE ARBITRATION
CASE.</p></div>


<p>When the construction of the Great Western
Railway was in contemplation, the
prospect of the Londoner being able to pay a
morning visit to Bristol, in even four or five
hours, was hailed with satisfaction, as will be
gathered from the following article from <i>The Sun</i>
newspaper of March 26th, 1832:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Railway from London to Bristol.</span>&mdash;We
understand that two civil engineers of eminence,
Henry H. Price and Wm. Brunton, Esqrs., are
busily occupied (under the auspices of some
leading interests) in making the necessary surveys
for the above important work. We hail with
satisfaction the prospect of seeing the metropolis,
ere long, thus closely approximated to the Bristol
Channel and Western Seas, when four or five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
hours will enable us to pay a morning visit to
Bristol. Nothing can tend more to increase and
consolidate the power of the empire than to give
the greatest possible facility of intercourse between
its distant points. When the London and
Bristol railway shall be completed, it will be very
possible, in connexion with the Irish steam-boats
from the latter port, for cattle and other Irish
produce to be conveyed to the London market
within 32 hours from the time of shipment at
Cork, Waterford, &amp;c., and thus, at a cheap rate,
will the London market be thrown immediately
open to the Irish agriculturist; at the same time
the London consumers will be benefited in proportion
to the greater extent of country thrown
open whence they may derive their supplies.
Liverpool, we understand, imports above 7,000
head of live stock per week; much of which is
conveyed to Manchester by the railway, and we
may surely hope for a similar result to the
metropolis, when the direct communication is
opened with Ireland by similar means. In a
political point of view, the importance of the
great work in question is too obvious to require a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
moment's comment. We need only state, that in
case of emergency, four to five hours will be
sufficient to convey any quantity of men or stores
from our dep&ocirc;ts or arsenals near London to
Bristol, whence they will be ready to embark for
any point where they may be required, and we at
once prove that railways, judiciously constructed
across the country, may be made, not only the
means of economy to the Government (smaller
establishments being necessary), but that they
tend more than anything else to concentrate and
consolidate the strength of an empire, and are an
additional guarantee against war and foreign
aggression."</p>

<p>In these days of special trains, composed
exclusively of Post Office carriages, such for
instance as the night mail on the Great Western
Railway, leaving Paddington at 9.5 p.m., consisting
of eight coaches with engine (usually the
&quot;Alexandra&quot; or &quot;Duke of York&quot;), and measuring
400 feet in length, which runs the whole
journey from London to Penzance in the space
of 9 hours 40 minutes, stopping at Bristol and a
few other first-class stations en route, it may be
interesting to recall the earliest period of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
conveyance of mails by railway. Light is
thrown thereon in the following correspondence
relating to the then conveyance of the mails to
Manchester and Liverpool, partly by the recently-constructed
railway, and partly by road:&mdash;"Liverpool,
4th July, 1837. Dear Sir, We
reached this place precisely at half-past twelve&mdash;exactly
an hour behind our time&mdash;the loss arose
out of various little <i>contretemps</i>, which a little
practice will set right. This is the first time in
Europe so long a journey was performed in so
short a time, and if, some very few years ago, it
had been said a letter could be answered by return
of post from London, the idea would have been
treated as chimerical, and yet at eight last evening
was I in London, and this letter will reach there
to-morrow morning, the proceeding of these
operations occupying a period of 34&frac12; hours only,
out of which a rest of three hours is to be taken,
thus performing a distance of 412 miles in 31&frac12;
hours.</p>

<p>"Our mail coach was before its time full 15
minutes, notwithstanding at one place we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
not find horses, except posters; and at another
when posters were found there was no coachman;
luckily there was one on the mail, looking out for
a place, with which we suited him. To-night,
doubtless, all will go right (some dispute among
the amiable contractors, I believe to be the
cause). I need hardly observe that I have
adopted proper measures. I have the honour
to be, Dear Sir, Yours very faithfully, (Signed)
Geo. Louis. To Lt.-Col. Maberley, &amp;c., &amp;c.,

<p>"4th July, 1837. Manchester. G. Karstadt,
Esq. For the Postmaster-General. I enclose a
letter from Mr. Louis with this report from Mr.
Karstadt as to the first working of the railroad.
I am sorry to say that it appears from the time
bills an hour was lost upon the railroad coming
up. (Signed) J.V.L.M. (Lt.-Col. Maberly). 5th
July, 1837. Read, Lichfield (Lord Lichfield)."
The coaches running all the way through at this
period were timed to leave London at 8 p.m.,
and arrive at Liverpool and Manchester at 2.30
p.m. On the up journey the coaches left Manchester
and Liverpool at 11.30 a.m., and reached
London at 6.30 a.m.</p>

<p>The conveyance of the mail partly by road
and partly by rail came into operation on the
Western road from 1838 to 1841 as section by
section of the Great Western Railway became
completed. Thus, in 1840, mails which had come
by road between Maidenhead and Bath were
brought into Bristol by trains composed of very
primitive engines, tenders and coaches, as depicted
in the illustrations taken from engravings
of the period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. J.W. Arrowsmith, the world-wide known
Bristol Publisher, recently reprinted Arrowsmith's
Railway Guide of 1854, the year of its first issue.
It is interesting to note from the re-publication
that the shortest time in which Mails and
passengers were conveyed between London and
Plymouth was 7 hours, 25 minutes, and between
Plymouth and London 7 hours, 35 minutes.
What a change a half-century has brought about!
The pace of the trains has been vastly increased,
and even goods trains accomplish the journey
from London to Bristol in three hours. There is
no such thing as finality in speed, as the Great
Western Railway Company has been trying a
French engine, with a view to beat all previous
records. One of these engines was tried in France
with the equivalent of fifteen loaded coaches
behind it. It was brought to a dead stop on a
steep incline, and when started again it gathered
speed, so that before the summit was reached it
was travelling at its normal speed&mdash;74.6 miles an
hour.</p>

<p>This new engine, "La France," recently accomplished
a brilliant feat. She was started from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Exeter with a load of twelve of the largest corridor-bogies,
one being a "diner," the whole weight
behind her tender, including passengers, staff,
luggage, and stores, being nearly 330 tons. "La
France" ran the 75&frac12; miles to Temple Meads
Station, Bristol, in 72&frac12; minutes, start to stop,
thus averaging 62.5 miles an hour, although she
had to face a 20-mile climb at the start, the last
27 miles of this stretch being at 1 in 115. She
went on from Bristol to London, 118&frac12; miles, with
the same heavy load, in exactly 118 minutes.
Her time from Bath to Paddington, 107 miles,
was 104 minutes; from Swindon, 77&frac14; miles, 72
minutes; from Reading, 36 miles, 33 minutes.</p>

<p>A good performance in long distance railway
running was established by the Great Western
Railway Company in connection with the visit in
1903 of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Cornwall.
Their Royal Highnesses left Paddington in
a special division of the Cornishman at 10.40 a.m.,
the train being timed to do the non-stop run to
North Road, Plymouth, a distance of 245 miles,
in four hours and a half. This time was, however,
reduced to the extent of 36&frac14; min., the train
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>steaming into North Road at 33&frac34; minutes past
2 o'clock. The train covered during the first
hour's run 67&frac34; miles, the average speed for the
whole journey to Plymouth being 1.049 miles
per minute. The journey was performed in
about half the time occupied in 1854.</p>

</div>

<p>The up train, which runs from Bristol to London
in exactly two hours, via Badminton, is matched
by a down train in the same time by the easier
but slightly longer main line (<i>via</i> Bath), giving a
start-to-stop speed of 59-1/8 miles an hour, with
a dead slow through Bath Station. But to Bath,
where a coach is slipped, the inclusive speed is
60 miles an hour, as the distance is 107 miles (all
but 10 chains), and the time from Paddington,
1 hr. 47 min. This is by the 10.50 a.m.
"Cornishman," and is said to be the first Great
Western train ever booked at a mile a minute,
and the first train on any London Railway even
"scheduled" at that speed.</p>

<p>In connection with the Mail Services between
the Metropolis and Bristol, the "Gate of the West,"
it may be appropriate here to mention the recent
arbitration case between the Great Western Rail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>way
Company and H.M. Postmaster-General in
regard to remuneration for conveyance of Mails.</p>

<p>The Company, dissatisfied with the payment of
&pound;115,000 a year under their contract of 1885,
subsequently raised by small additions, from time
to time, to &pound;126,000 a year, brought their case
before the Railway Commissioners, who awarded
&pound;135,855 a year from the 1st July, 1902. This
amount covered the provision of a new postal
train in each direction between London and
Penzance. It was Sir Frederick Peel who delivered
the judgment of the Court.</p>

</div>

<p>Post Offices showing signs of great antiquity
are scarcely in existence now, for at the present
day the wide district thus described in the preceding
paragraph contains within its boundaries
only one post office established under the
primitive but comfortable and picturesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
thatched roof. This is the Horton Post Office.
The picture of this post office is from an excellent
photograph taken by Miss Begbie, a daughter of
the Rector of Horton. The village lies at the
foot of the Cotswolds, and near this spot, in
quiet retreat, William Tyndale translated the
New Testament. The Duke of Beaufort's
hounds meet from time to time in the Horton
Post Office yard. This rustic place was originally
the village ale house, yclept "The Horse Shoe."
It is now devoted to the more useful purpose of
the sale of stamps and the posting and distribution
of letters, under the able and energetic
superintendence of Mrs. Slade.</p>

<p>Such Postal Sub-Districts as Horton, far remote
from their principal centre, were classified under
Parliamentary legislation. Thus the fifth Clause
posts of early in the 19th Century took their name
from the Act 41, Geo. 3, Ch. 7, Clause 5, under
which they were established. Special post marks
were in use for such posts. In the case of the
Bristol district there was only one 5th Clause
post, namely, at Thornbury, which was established
in 1825, and under its regulations one penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
was charged for the delivery of each letter at
Thornbury. The post was a horse post from
and to Bristol, and the Contractor delivered
and collected bags at Almondsbury and Fylton,
which were both "penny posts." The main
object of the fifth Clause post was to join up
small towns with the larger post towns and so it
was that Thornbury became thus linked on to
Bristol. On the other hand, Bristol had 63 penny
posts, including Almondsbury and Fylton, which
were denoted by numbers 1 to 63, Clifton being
No. 1.</p>

<p>Of the 52 "Fifth Clause Posts" existing in 1839
Bristol had only the one which joined Bristol
and Thornbury.</p>

<p>Owing to there being no settled port of departure
or arrival for vessels employed for conveyance
of Foreign Mails, the letters were frequently
despatched by privately-owned ships. They were
then impressed with a post-mark "Ship Letter,"
with the name of the town included.</p>

<p>The Penny Post letters were such as had been
posted in any one of the 63 Bristol Penny Post
Sub-District Offices for delivery in the district of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
posting, or in any of the 62 other Offices. Thus
a letter posted in Fylton for delivery in Fylton
would be charged one penny upon being handed
in at that Post Office, and another penny would
be obtained on delivery to the addressee.</p>

<p>A letter posted at the Penny Post Office of
Almondsbury for delivery in the Penny Post
District of Fylton would be charged a penny
upon being handed in at the Almondsbury Office
and another penny would be charged to the
addressee on delivery. Thornbury being a 5th
Clause Post would have letters posted in its
special "Open" box, delivered in the Thornbury
Postal area for the one penny, that charged on
delivery.</p>

<p>A letter posted in the "Open" box at Thornbury
(5th Clause Post) for Bristol would likewise
travel from Poster to addressee for the 1d. delivery
charge in Bristol, as bags would be exchanged
between the two places.</p>

<p>A single letter, <i>i.e.</i>, a letter without an enclosure,
coming from Reading for Thornbury, would
be charged a general post rate of 8d. to Bristol,
plus 1d. for delivery, which would be the same in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the cases of letters from Reading for Fylton or
Almondsbury; but if a letter were posted at
Thornbury for Reading, there would be no charge
from Thornbury to Bristol, so that the addressee
would only be called upon to pay the general
post rate of 8d., whereas, the postage on a letter
from Fylton or Almondsbury would be 8d., plus
a penny charged for collection.</p>

<p>The mail services in the rural districts are not
free from danger. The pitcher may have been
carried to the fountain year after year without
mishap, but it not infrequently becomes broken
at last. In like manner the contractor for the
Portishead, Clevedon, and Yatton mail cart
service, after having driven over this route with
immunity from accident for forty years, yet
came to grief in the last week of his connection
with His Majesty's mails, January, 1902. The
contractor's time table was arranged thus:&mdash;Portishead,
leave 9.15 p.m.; Clevedon, arrive
10.5 p.m., leave 10.50 p.m.; Yatton, arrive 11.28
p.m.; attend to apparatus and up mail 12.17
a.m., down mail 12.42 a.m.; Yatton, leave
1.5 a.m.; Clevedon, arrive 1.48 a.m., depart
4.15 a.m.; Portishead, arrive 5.5 a.m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The contractor, Mr. Dawes, now in the 66th year
of his age, having performed a part of his outward
journey on the 19th September, 1902, left Clevedon
for Yatton quite sober as ever, and in his usual
health. Then comes the mystery. He did not
reach Yatton in due course, and the railway
signalman intimated the failure to Bristol, from
which office the postmaster of Clevedon was
advised, who at early dawn started out a scout
on a bicycle to search for the missing mailman and
mail bags. The scout discovered no signs of
man or mails between Clevedon and the Yatton
apparatus station, and going back over the same
ground, he eventually met an individual who had
seen an aged man with a whip in his hand wandering
on the road. This he knew to be his man,
and he discovered Dawes walking aimlessly along
the road at about 7 a.m. His explanations were
not coherent. The horse had ran away with him,
and flung him off the cart into a ditch; he had
tumbled off the cart, and walked into a ditch;
he had tried to knock people up to assist him in
trying to find what had become of the missing
mails! In the meantime, a farm labourer going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
out on to the Kingston Seymour moors to milk
the cows discovered the mail cart turned over on
to its side, and thus embedded in a rhine on the
roadside. The horse also was in the rhine, up
to his back, partly in mud and partly in water.
The milkman immediately started off to Clevedon
to give the alarm, and his employer, who was
accompanying him on his journey to the milking
ground, took prompt steps, in conjunction with
moor men, to drag horse and vehicle out of the
mud and mire. Fortunately, the mailbags were
uninjured, and the postmaster of Clevedon, who
had set out on a search, had them conveyed back
to his office. Dazed contractor Dawes, the muddy
mail cart, and horse coated with mud from head
to hoofs, were got back into the town at about
11 a.m. It would seem that the contractor fell
asleep and tumbled from his box into the road,
and that his horse wandered on, grazing from side
to side of the road, till eventually in the dark of
night horse and cart fell into the rhine. On coming
to himself, the contractor, after trying in vain to
arouse the inhabitants of roadside houses, wandered
about all night, or it may be laid down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
somewhere to await morning light. The animal
was injured to such an extent that it had to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>During the fierce gale which, with unparalleled
severity, raged in the Bristol Channel on the night
of Thursday, the 10th September, 1903, a vessel
was driven ashore on the Gore Sands. Soon
after daybreak a call was made for the Burnham
Lifeboat, but, in consequence of the heavy seas,
the crew was unable to launch her. The coxswain,
therefore, telegraphed for the Watchet
Lifeboat to proceed to the rescue. Every endeavour
was made by the Postal Telegraph
authorities to expeditiously transmit the message,
but the elements which had operated against the
vessel, had likewise played havoc with the telegraph
wires, with the result that the telegram
sustained such delay in transmission as to retard
the launching of the Lifeboat. Fortunately, no
serious consequences followed.</p>

<p>As regards mail communication, the night
journey by road from Bristol to Bath and
Chippenham could not be made, owing to the
roads being blocked by fallen trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The gale was far reaching in its effects, and
carried away parts of Weston-super-Mare Pier,
landed boats on promenade, blew down walls,
chimneys, and laid low hundreds of trees, was
especially "a howler," and disastrous as regards
interference with telegraphic communication.
Wires were blown down in all directions, and
Bristol suffered greatly. On the 11th, at 11.0
a.m., there was no wire whatever available to
South Wales, and telegrams had to be sent by
train. There was no wire available to Scotland
or to the north beyond Birmingham, or to Cork
and Jersey. Several local lines were down, such
as Wedmore, Hambrook, Yatton, Portishead,
Wickwar, etc. Delay of 50 minutes occurred to
Birmingham, which office transmitted all work
for the north. The delay to London was 40
minutes. Trunk telephone communication was
impossible. Every wire was interrupted, and
remained so all day. In the evening there was
still no wire which could be used to Scotland,
Cork, or Channel Islands. Cardiff was reached
at 3.0 p.m., on one wire.</p>

<p>Bristol "lethargic" was for years the
general idea of the place. Bristol
"awakening" followed, and it is now realised
that Bristol has fully awakened to her vast potentialities.
The eyes of the populace of Great
Britain, and, it may be, of many of the dwellers
in the King's dominions beyond the seas, were
in March, 1902, cast in the direction of the
ancient city of Bristol, erstwhile the second
port in importance in the British Isles. This
national looking to what Bristolians proudly
call the "metropolis of Western England"
was occasioned by the visit of the Prince of
Wales, with H.R.H. the Princess, to turn the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
first sod in connection with the great works
then about to be undertaken for the extension
of the docks at Avonmouth, so as to render
them capable of accommodating and berthing
steamers of a magnitude greater than any yet
built&mdash;a work then expected to be completed in
four or five years. The function was a notable
one, and the occasion may be briefly summed up
as "a grand day for Bristol." Two millions are
being spent on the dock, which will have a water
space of thirty acres, with room for further extension.
The lock will be 875 feet long and 100
feet wide. There will be 5,000 feet of quay
space, with abundant railway sidings and other
appointments of a first-class port.</p>

<p>In Feb., 1902, Sir Alfred Jones, K.C.M.G., the
chief of the Elder Dempster steamship line, set
out from Avonmouth in the "Port Antonio" for
Jamaica, with the object of promoting further
developments between Bristol and the West
Indies by means of the Imperial Direct West
India mail service. The occasion of his departure
was unusually interesting, as it took
place on the first anniversary of the sailing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the first boat of the direct service carrying
H. Majesty's mails to the Island of Jamaica
from Avonmouth. The picture portrays the
mails being embarked on the "Antonio's"
sister ship, the "Port Royal," which arrived
at Avonmouth on the day before the royal visit,
and was inspected by Their Royal Highnesses,
who were much interested in her banana cargo.
The "Port Kingston," a steamer of larger size and
splendid construction, has now been added to the
Jamaican fleet, and she makes the passage from
Kingston to Bristol in ten-and-a-half days. By a
coincidence, when Bristol was "feasting" on the
5th March, 1902&mdash;the Red Letter Day&mdash;and
its senior Burgess, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and the other Members of Parliament
for the city were felicitating with a goodly array
of Bristol Fathers over the great event likely
to be fraught with untold benefit to the historic
port from which Sebastian Cabot set forth years
and years ago to seek and find the continent
of America, the feast of "St. Martin's" was
being held at the Criterion, in London, and the
Post Office K.C.B.'s, Sir George Murray, Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Spencer Walpole, and Sir William Preece, under
the courtly presidency of Sir Robert Hunter,
were eloquently descanting to a large assemblage
of Post Office <i>literati</i> on the usefulness of
the Post Office Service magazine&mdash;St. Martin's
le Grand.</p>

</div>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce at this time urged
on the Canadian Government the desirability
of making Bristol the terminal port for the new
Canadian fast mail service, on the grounds that
mails and passengers from Canada can be carried
into London and the Midlands in the shortest
period of time <i>via</i> the old port of Bristol. From
the Holms, 20 miles below Bristol, a straight
line in deep water, without any intervening land,
may be drawn to Halifax. Bristol can be reached
from London in 2 hours. The time which could be
saved in the passage from Queenstown to London
<i>via</i> Bristol is 5&frac12; hours as compared with the route
<i>via</i> Liverpool, and 5 hours as compared with
the route <i>via</i> Southampton. By the Severn
Tunnel line there is also direct communication
with the Lancashire and Yorkshire manufacturing
districts, as well as the Midland and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Northern parts of the United Kingdom generally.
Thus in the two important elements of speed and
safety Bristol has paramount advantages as a
terminal port for the transatlantic mail service.
There is evidence generally that Bristol trade
and commerce have revived, and are now indicating
a vigorous growth. The Bristol post
office statistics show a phenomenal progress
during the last decade. In the year 1837, before
the introduction of the penny postage system,
and when people had to pay for their missives
on delivery, Bristol could only boast of 1,040,000
letters delivered in a year; in 1841, the year
after the uniform penny postage was introduced,
the number rose to 2,392,000. In another ten
years, 1851, 5,668,000 was reached; in 1861,
11,062,252 was the number; 1871, 12,158,000;
in 1881, 19,484,000; 1891, 29,000,000; and in
1901, 55,473,000, or an increase approaching
that of the preceding forty years. The numbers
stand in 1905 at 73,000,000.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 10th January, 1904, the liner
"Philadelphia" (which, by-the-bye, as the "City
of Paris" went ashore on the Manacles and was
salved and re-named) was the first of the fleet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of the American Line to call at Plymouth and
land the American mails there, instead of at
Southampton, as formerly. In connection with
the inauguration of this service to the Western
port of Plymouth, Bristol&mdash;undoubtedly a natural
geographical centre for the distribution of mails
from the United States and Canada&mdash;played an
important part in distributing and thus greatly
accelerating the delivery of the American correspondence
generally. Bristol itself distinctly
benefits by the American mail steamers calling
at Plymouth, for it enables her traders to get
their business correspondence many hours earlier
than by any other route.</p>

<p>Owing to a severe storm encountered off
Sandy Hook, the "Philadelphia," on the occasion
alluded to, due on Saturday, did not arrive
in Plymouth Sound until early on Sunday
morning. The mails were quickly placed aboard
the tender, which returned to Millbay Docks
at 6.20 a.m., and an hour later the special
G.W.R. train moved out, carrying over 21
tons of mails. Eight tons were at 10 a.m.
put out at the Temple Meads Railway Station<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to be dealt with at the Bristol Post Office,
and the remainder taken on to Paddington.
The mails dealt with at Bristol included not only
those for delivery in Bristol city and district,
but also those for the provinces. They were
speedily sorted and dispersed by the comprehensive
through train services to the West,
South Wales, Midlands, and North of England.</p>

<p>The second American mail was brought over
by the "St. Louis," which arrived off Plymouth
at one o'clock on Saturday morning, the 16th
January, 1904. The G.W. train reached Temple
Meads at 6.23, and 350 bags which had to be dealt
with at Bristol were dropped. The premises
recently acquired from the Water Works Company
by the Post Office were utilized for the first time,
there not being sufficient room in the existing
post office buildings to cope with such a heavy
consignment. The letters were sent out with
the first morning delivery in Bristol. The
Birmingham letters were despatched at 10.30 a.m.,
and those for Manchester and Liverpool were
also sent off in time for delivery in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The third mail arrived per "New York," at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
7.35 p.m. on Saturday, the 23rd January, 1904.
One hundred and fifty bags were deposited at
Bristol. The New York direct mails for the North
went on by the 7.40 p.m. (G.W.) and 7.55 p.m.
(Mid.) trains ex Bristol Station. The direct
Plymouth and Bristol service is still being continued.</p>

<p>In an Instruction Book relating to "Ship
Letter" Duty which was in use in the Bristol
Post Office so far back as 1833, there are many
interesting documents. The following is a list:&mdash;(1)

<p>This old book relating to the Ship Letter Duty
at Bristol was considered suitable for the
Muniment Room at St. Martin's-le-Grand, as an
historical record, and is retained there for preservation.
It is considered fortunate that it has
survived so long.</p>

<p>As the public eye was for a long time directed
towards the Redland Post Office, Bristol, which to
meet the wants of the community has been located
by the Department at No. 112, White Ladies Road,
Black Boy Hill, and is carried on apart altogether
from any trade or business, it may be well, in
view of connecting links with the past being
rapidly effaced in the march of modern progress,
to take an historical retrospect of this local post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
office so far as evidence is forthcoming, and thus
endeavour to put on record the traditions of the
past. It would appear, then, according to the
earliest evidence obtainable, that Mr. W. Newman
had the appointment of postman and town letter
receiver conferred upon him in 1827, offices
which he held until 1872. The post office was
carried on by him in a small house approached
by garden and steps immediately adjoining the
old King's Arms Inn, which stood on the site
of the present Inn of that name. It was Newman's
mission in those pre-penny stamp days
to serve the wide and then open district bordered
by Pembroke Road, White Ladies Gate, Cold
Harbour Farm, Redland Green, Red House
Farm, Stoke Bishop, Cote House, and Sea Mills.
He delivered about 40 letters daily. The area
owing to the growth of population and the spread
of education, with the consequent development
of letter writing, has now seven post offices; is
served by no fewer than 30 postmen, and has
a delivery of 14,000 letters.</p>

<p>In Mr. Newman's early Post Office days mail
coaches ran up and down Black Boy Hill on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
their way to and from the New Passage, and
called at the Redland Post Office. Newman is
said to have had a jackdaw. The bird, as the
mail coach ran down the narrow road on Black
Boy Hill, called "Mail, mail, quick, quick!"
to attract his master's attention, and, waggish
bird as he was, he not infrequently gave a false
alarm, and called his master at the wrong time.
After some years Mr. Newman moved with the
Post Office to the east side of Black Boy Hill,
to a house near the present Porter Stores. He
was succeeded by Mr. Enoch Park. The next
sub-postmaster was the late Mr. Buswell, who
for some years occupied premises on mid-hill,
before moving the Post Office to a site lower
down the hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/illus-041.jpg" width="100%" alt="MR. F.P. LANSDOWN." title="" />
<span class="caption">MR. F.P. LANSDOWN.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. F.P. Lansdown retired from the post of
Medical Officer to the Bristol Post Office at the
end of the year 1903. He had occupied the
position for the period of 42 years, and it was
felt that such long service could not be allowed
to terminate without due recognition at the hands
of the officers of the Postal and Telegraph Services,
to whom he had rendered professional aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
from time to time. He was, therefore, given a
solid silver table lamp, subscribed for by over
650 members of the staff. The presentation
took place on Post Office premises, and was very
largely attended.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven of the Bristol telegraph staff
served in the campaign in South Africa. In
times of peace many Royal Engineers are
employed in the instrument room of the Bristol
Post Office, and the duties of linesmen are
mainly undertaken by men from that corps.
On the outbreak of hostilities, these were at
once withdrawn for active service, and then
came the call for Volunteers for the Telegraph
Battalion, when seven civilians attached to the
local staff volunteered, and were selected. Great
interest was taken by their confreres in the progress
of the war, especially during the siege and
the relief of Ladysmith, where two of the Bristol
R.E.'s were among the besieged. One of the
staff went through the siege of Kimberley, and
another for his pluck was awarded the D.S.
Medal. A hearty welcome awaited their return,
and this was manifested by means of a supper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
musical evening at St. Stephen's Restaurant,
Dec. 1, 1902.</p>

<p>Not all of them came back&mdash;two had fallen
and helped to swell the large number who had
sacrificed their lives for their King and country.</p>

<p>Whilst civilian telegraphists and officers of the
sorting department thus volunteered for military
service in South Africa, the present Postmaster-General
himself, Lord Stanley, to whom this
book is dedicated, also was not slow in placing
himself at the disposal of his country, and he
went through two years of the campaign, acting
first as Press Censor and afterwards as Private
Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief Lord
Roberts. He was twice mentioned in despatches
and was awarded the Companionship of the Bath.</p>

<p>Bristolians generally, with great enthusiasm,
rallied to the cry for Volunteers, and special
mention may here be made of Mr. J. Paul Bush,
who ungrudgingly gave up his large and fashionable
practice as a surgeon in Clifton, and, at very brief
notice, hurried off to South Africa to occupy the
position of senior surgeon to the Princess Christian
Hospital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>He was mentioned by Lord Roberts in despatches,
and the Companionship of the Order of
St. Michael and St. George was conferred on him.</p>

<p>Small wonder then, that on Mr. Lansdown's
retirement from the Bristol Medical Officership at
the end of 1903, Lord Stanley should have selected
Mr. Paul Bush to fill the appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Bush had the further claim to the appointment
as being a medical man born in the city of
Bristol, and having for an ancestor Paul Bush,
the first Bishop of Bristol, who was born in 1491.
He is the son of the late Major Robert Bush,
96th Regiment, who was particularly patriotic in
having largely assisted in the formation of the 1st
Bristol Rifle Volunteer Corps, of which he became
Colonel in command. In addition to certain
honorary medical and surgical appointments in
the city, Mr. Bush holds the position of chief
surgeon to the Bristol Constabulary.</p>

<p>From time immemorial Small Street, in the
city and county of Bristol, two-thirds of
the west side of which the Post Office occupies,
has been an important street. One of the nine
old town gates was at the bottom of it, and was
known as St. Giles's Gate, having obtained this
name from a church dedicated to St. Giles, the
patron saint of cripples and beggars, which in
the fifteenth century stood at the end of "Seynt-Lauren's-Laane."
Here, history says, was the
"hygest walle of Bristow," which has "grete
vowtes under it, and the old chyrch of Seynt
Gylys was byldyd ovyr the vowtes." The cutting
of the trench, from the old Stone Bridge to near
Prince Street Bridge, for the new channel of the
Froom, was completed in 1247. Before this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
date ships could only lie in the Avon, where the
bottom was "very stony and rough"; but the
bed of the new course of the Froom having
turned out to be soft and muddy, it became the
harbour for the great ships, and Small Street
from this time became a principal thoroughfare.
Then to this quarter of the town came Bristol's
greatest merchants. From the centre of the
town to the old Custom House, at the lower end
of Pylle Street (now St. Stephen Street) there
was no nearer way than down Small Street and
through St. Giles's Gate. The existence of gardens
in the 15th and 16th centuries at the backs
of the Houses in Small Street is evidenced by
the wills of old Bristolians. In that of William
Hoton, merchant, of St. Werburgh's parish, who
died in 1475, is mentioned "the garden of Sir
Henry Hungerford, Knight," near the cemetery
of St. Leonard's Church, and John Easterfield,
merchant, of St. Werburgh's parish, who died
in 1504, bequeathed to his wife his dwelling-house
in Small-Strete, and also "the garden in
St. Leonard's Lane, as long as she dwelleth in the
said house."</p>

<span class="caption">ELTON MANSION, SMALL STREET, BRISTOL.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>In this historic Small Street, and just within
the old city walls, have for two or three hundred
years stood certain premises, in olden times
divided into three separate holdings, the freehold
of which was purchased in 1903 from the
Bristol Water Works Company by the Post
Office, for much-needed extensions to its already
large building. The facts respecting these three
edifices have been culled from ancient parchments
which would fill a large wheelbarrow.
The premises are not of very ornate exterior
now. They are interesting, however, as denoting
an old style of architecture; but the
exteriors have, no doubt, been so altered and
pulled about to meet the requirements of successive
occupiers as to be not quite like what
they were originally. The structures appear to
have been erected in the middle of the 17th
century, probably at the end of the reign of
King Charles I. (1649). The plan of Brightstowe,
published in 1581 by Hofnagle, shows
that the Church of St. Werburgh and its churchyard
occupied one-third of the frontage of the
street, on the west, or Post Office, side, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
there were only five other separate buildings,
which were each detached, and covered the
remainder of the length of the street. Millerd's
"Exact Delineations of the famous Cittie of
Bristoll," published in 1673, does not so clearly
illustrate the houses standing in Small Street
on its west or Post Office side as could be desired.
The deeds hereafter alluded to indicate, however,
that of the three premises under consideration,
the Elton Mansion, at least, was standing
before 1680, as Richard Streamer, who died in
that year, is named as having formerly dwelt
therein. There is no earlier record, and as
Streamer only came to fame as councillor in
1661, it may, perhaps, be assumed that the
mansion was erected about the year 1650; and
as a member of the Cann family is the first known
owner of the property, no doubt the house was
erected for him. The style of architecture
appears to bear out that assumption as to date,
and the frontages indicate that the three houses
under special review were erected about the
same time.</p>

<p>While there may be a little regret when these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
medi&aelig;val buildings disappear, there will be the
advantage of the street being considerably
widened by their removal. It is now only 20
feet wide from house to house, and gives a very
good idea of its appropriate appellation&mdash;Small
Street. Taking first the property which formed
the middle holding, now (1905) known as
7, Small Street, and which was not, therefore,
actually contiguous to the existing Post Office,
the earliest date alluded to in the parchments
is the year 1700. In a deed of the 14th August,
1723, it is stated that Sir Abraham Elton, merchant,
under indenture of lease dated 28th
February, 1700, had bought from Sir Thomas
Cann, of Stoke Bishopp, in the county of Gloucester,
Esq., "All that great messuage or dwelling-house
situate standing and being in Small Street
within the Parishes of St. Walburgh (<i>sic</i>) and
St. Leonard." The indenture was between Sir
Abraham Elton, Bart., on the one part, and
Christopher Shuter, of the same city, on the
other part, and was worded thus: "Now this
Indenture witnesseth that for and in consideration
of the sum of five shillings of lawful money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of Great Britain to the said Sir Abraham Elton
in hand paid by the said Christopher Shuter
the receipt whereof the said Sir Abraham Elton
doth hereby confess and acknowledge and for
divers good causes and considerations him the
said Sir Abraham Elton hereunto moving hath
granted bargained sold assigned and set over ... unto
the said Christopher Shuter
all the said messuage and tenements to have and
to hold unto the said Christopher Shuter his
executors administrators and assigns from henceforth
for and during all the rest and residue of
the above recited terms of 70 years which is yet
to run and unexpired in trust for said Sir
Abraham Elton."</p>

<p>The next record is that bearing date of the
next day, thus:&mdash;"Mr. Cann's lease for a year
of a Messuage in Small Street to Sir Abraham
Elton. Date 15th August, 1723." Robert Cann
"doth demise grant bargain and sell unto the
said Sir Abraham Elton all that great messuage
or dwelling house situate standing and being in
Small Street within the parishes of St. Walburgh
and St. Leonards or one of them within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the said city of Bristol wherein Richard Streamer
Esq. (who died in 1680) formerly dwelt and
wherein Sir William Poole, Knt. (no trace of
him can be found in local records) afterwards
dwelt and now (1723) the dwelling of and in the
possession of the said Sir Abraham Elton (First
Baronet) (where also Sir Abraham Elton, the
grandson, successively dwelt, and, after that,
William Thornhill, surgeon) and fronting forwards
to the street called Small Street and extending
backwards to a lane called St. Leonard's
Lane and bounded on the outside thereof with a
messuage in the holding of William Donne,
Ironmonger, and afterwards (1746) John Perks,
Tobacconist (now 1905, known as No. 6 in
Small Street and actually adjoining the Post Office)
and on the other side thereof with a messuage in
the tenure of William Knight, Cooper (and afterwards
of Richard Lucas, Cooper) (now 1905,
known as No. 8 Small Street and last occupied by
Messrs. Bartlett and Hobbs, Wine Merchants),
together with all and singular Cellars, Sellars
Vaults, Rooms, Halls, Parlors, Chambers,
Kitchens, Lofts, Lights, Basements, Backsides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
pavements, court yards and appurtenances
whatsoever"&mdash;for one whole year, yielding and
paying therefor the rent of a peppercorn on the
feast of St. Michael the Archangel (if the same
shall be demanded). Signed and sealed, Robert
Cann. In the Abstract of Title it is noted that
William Knight, who occupied the house on the
"other side," was succeeded in the tenure by
Richard Lucas, cooper. On the 14th August,
1746, Sir Abraham Elton (3rd Bart.) and
assignees leased the premises as before described
to Dr. Logan, of the city of Bristol, doctor in
physick, for 5s., as in the case of Christopher
Shuter. The house of William Donne, ironmonger,
adjoining, was in this deed mentioned
as occupied by John Perks, tobacconist. The
property appears to have been sold by William
Logan, of Pennsylvania, Esq., and nephew and
heir of the above-mentioned Dr. Logan, doctor
of physick, of the city of Bristol, to the "Small
Street Company (Richard Reynolds, Edward
Garlick, Richard Summers, James Harford,
William Cowles, James Getly)" on the 27th May,
1772. In the year 1847 the property was leased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to the Bristol Water Works Company, and purchased
by the company in 1865.</p>

<p>The several owners and occupiers of this "great
house" were persons of no mean degree, as the
following statement of their local positions indicates.
According to Playfair's "British Family
Antiquity," Vol. VII., Mr. Robert Cann was the
eldest son of Sir Thomas Cann, who was the
eldest son of Sir Robert Cann, the first baronet.
Sir Robert Cann was the eldest son of William
Cann, Esqr., Alderman of Bristol. He married
the sister of Sir Robert Yeomans, who was beheaded
at Bristol for supporting the cause of
Charles I. Sir Robert was Councillor, 1649-1663;
Sheriff, 1651-1652; Treasurer, Merchant Venturers,
1653-1654; Master, Merchant Venturers,
1658-1659; Mayor, 1662-1663; Knighted, 1662;
created Baronet, 1662; Alderman 1663-1685;
Mayor, 1675-1676. Under the south window of
St. Werburgh's Church was a handsome monument,
with a half-arch, for the family of Sir
Robert Cann, of Compton-Greenfield, Bart.
Richard Streamer was Councillor, 1661-1672;
Sheriff, 1663-1664; Alderman, 1672-1680; Mayor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
1673-1674; Master, Merchant Venturers, 1672-1673;
died 1680. Sir William Pool cannot be
traced in the local histories which have been
consulted. Sir Abraham Elton (first baronet),
baptized 3 July, 1654, at St. Philip and St. Jacob
Church, was the son of Isaac and Elizabeth Elton,
of that parish. From entries in the registers, it
may be seen that the family was settled there as
early as 1608, about which time the members of it
migrated from near Ledbury to the neighbourhood,
attracted doubtless by the splendid field for
enterprise offered by the second City of the Kingdom,
as Bristol undoubtedly was at that period,
and for some time afterwards. They were
Puritans, and held some land in Barton Regis on
the Gloucestershire side of the city. Richard
Elton, bap. at St. Philip and St. Jacob, 29 April,
1610, was a Colonel in Fairfax's Army, and he
published one of the earliest text books in the
English language on military tactics; hence the
family motto, "Artibus et Armis." A copy of
this book is now in Clevedon Court Library, with
its quaint frontispiece, portrait and inscription:
"Richard Elton, of Bristol, 1649, aetas suae 39."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>Sir Abraham was apprenticed in 1670 to his
eldest brother, Jacob Elton, but in 1672 went
to sea. He married in 1676 Mary, daughter
of Robert Jefferies, a member of a well-known
mercantile family of that day. He served in
many public offices, thus:&mdash;President, Gloucestershire
Society, 1689; Councillor, 1699-1712;
Sheriff, 1702-1703; Master, Merchant Venturers,
1708-1709; Mayor, 1710-1711; Alderman, 1712-1728;
Governor, Incorporation of Poor, 1713-1715;
High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, 1716;
created baronet, 1717; Mayor, September, 1720;
M.P., 1722-1727.</p>

which are here given, are reproduced, with Sir
Edmund Elton's kind consent, from photographs

Clevedon. The original oil paintings hang in the
picture gallery at Clevedon Court.</p>

<p>According to Barrett, in the St. Werburgh's
vestry room, over the door on the inside, as
part of a long Latin inscription, was the name
of "Abrahamo Eltono, Guardianis, 1694." The
baronetcy was conferred on him in recognition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of his staunch support of the Hanoverian succession
during the Jacobite riots of 1715-16, to the
great disgust of Stewart, the local Jacobite
chronicler.</p>

<p>In the Board Room, at St. Peter's Hospital,
under the date 1700, Abraham Elton's name
appears as a benefactor for &pound;100.</p>

<p>In 1727, Sir Abraham Elton, Bart., gave &pound;2 10s.
per annum to five poor housekeepers in St.
Werburgh's parish not receiving alms, paid
September 11, &pound;50. He died at his house in
Small Street in the same year&mdash;1727. Having
bequeathed considerable sums in local charities,
he settled his estates in Somerset, Gloucestershire,
and Wilts, on various members of his family.
He was for many years head of the commerce of
Bristol, a pioneer of its brass and iron foundries,
owner of its principal weaving industry, and of
some of its glass and pottery works, besides largely
controlling the shipping of the port. His wife
survived him by only two months. They are
both buried in the family vault in SS. Philip
and Jacob Parish Church, within the altar rails
near Sir Abraham's parents. The house in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Small Street was their town house from about
1690 down to the date of their deaths.</p>

<p>Sir Abraham Elton (second baronet), baptized
30 June, 1679, at St. John the Baptist, Broad Street,
was Councillor, 1710-1723; Sheriff, 1710-1711;
Mayor, 1719-1720; Master, Merchant Venturers,
1719-1720; Alderman, 1723-1742; baronet, 1727;
M.P., 1727-1742; died October 19th, 1742. He
married on the 14th of May, 1702, Abigail,
daughter of Zachary Bayly, of Charlcot House,
Wilts, and of Northwood Park, Somerset.</p>

<p>Sir Abraham Elton (third baronet), born 1703,
was Councillor, 1728-1757; Sheriff, 1728-1729;
Baronet, 1742; Mayor, 1742-1743; died November
29th, 1761. He died unwed.</p>

<p>Christopher Shuter was Councillor, 1699-1715;
Sheriff, 1702-1703; Mayor, 1711-1712; Alderman,
1715-1730; Governor, Incorporation of Poor,
1715-1716; Warden, Merchant Venturers, 1718-1719;
died 1730.</p>

<p>William Thornhill was surgeon to the Infirmary,
1737-1754.</p>

<p>William Logan was physician to the Infirmary,
1737-1757; died December, 1757, aged 69.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>The neighbours on the right and left of the
Elton mansion, mentioned hereafter, were not
of great social consequence. There is, however,
mention of one of them, a John Knight, having
been warden of the Merchant Venturers' Society
in 1671-2.</p>

<p>The other premises (6 and 8&mdash;1903) stand on the
upper and lower sides respectively of the old
Elton Mansion. They belonged in 1709 to
Eleanor Seager, who mortgaged them to Edward
Cook for &pound;140. The property was described in
the mortgage deed thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All those two messuages or tenements situate
and being in Small Street in the Parish of St.
Walburg (<i>sic</i>) in the City of Bristol in one (No.
6&mdash;1905) of which said messuages John Knight
Gent now liveth and in the other of them (No.
8&mdash;1905) one M.E. Balley now doth or lastly did
inhabit and dwell, in the said City of Bristol
and all houses, outhouses, edifices, buildings,
courtyards, and backsides to the said messuage
or tenement."</p>

<p>The two messuages were leased to Mary
Knight by Eleanor Seager for 1s. in money by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>indenture of 26 June, 1716, thus:&mdash;"Between
John Saunders of Hazell in the parish of Olveston

Seager late of Hazell aforesaid on the one part

Balley Painter and Glazier doth also dwell (afterwards
in tenure or occupation of John Mason
Broker and Thomas Taman Gunsmith) and all
the outhouses," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. (as in 1709 mortgage
deed).</p>

<p>In 1758 (24 June) there was a conveyance of
the two messuages from Miss Knight to Mr.
Samuel Page (one of the partners with Edward
Garlick, Richard Reynolds, &amp;c.) for &pound;700. It
was this same firm which purchased the Elton
"Great House" in 1772.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The firm was known as Messrs. Reynolds,
Getley and Company, by virtue of an indenture
of co-partnership, dated 1st June, 1764. The
document was signed and sealed by Richard
Reynolds, Edward Garlick, Richard Summers,
James Harford, William Cowles, James Getley,
Samuel Page, William Weaver, John Partridge,
and John Partridge, jun. The firm was engaged
in the iron and tin-plate trades, and, according
to the <i>London Gazette</i> of Saturday, March 17th,
1820, it was being carried on under the style of
Harfords, Crocker, and Co. The partnership
dissolved on the 30th day of June, 1821, by Alicia
Calder, Elizabeth Weaver, and Sarah Davies
retiring from the firm, and by reason of the
death of the Philip Crocker. The business
was continued by Richard Summers Harford,
Samuel Harford, John Harford, William Green,
and William Weaver Davies, under the firm of
Harford Brothers and Co., under the date of
25th day of February, 1822.</p>

<p>These two tenements became the property of
the Bristol Water Works Company at the same
time as the Great House, in 1865, and a portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of ground at the back, facing St. Leonard's Lane,
belonging to the St. Werburgh's charities, in
1902.</p>

<p>The old chimney-piece&mdash;a fine specimen of
medi&aelig;val stone carving&mdash;which stood in the
principal upstairs room of No. 7, used as a boardroom
by the Water Works Company, the richly
decorated ceiling, and the panelled walls, marked
the period at which the Eltons occupied the
house; and the initials A. and M.E., representing
Abraham and Mary Elton (Mary, daughter of
Robert Jefferies, whom he married in 1676), and
the date, 1700, quaintly cut, are on the chimney-piece.
The chimney-piece has been removed,
and re-erected in the new Water Works building
in Telephone Avenue. The inquirer of the far-distant
future may be misled when he finds it in
this spot, unless, indeed, there be some tablet
provided to indicate and perpetuate the history
of this antique stone carving. The ceiling and
panelling have been purchased by Sir Edmund
Elton, and taken to Clevedon Court.</p>

<p>In letters to the <i>Bristol Times and Mirror</i> newspaper,
certain writers have, in treating of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Water Works premises, sought to establish that
the great philanthropist, Edward Colston,
possessed a mansion on the east side of Small
Street, and lived therein. No tangible facts
have, however, been adduced to substantiate
the statements. On the other hand, there is
very conclusive evidence to the contrary contained
in the notes on "Colston's House," read
at the annual meeting of this society, in 1890,
by the late historian of Bristol, John Latimer.
Mr. Latimer demonstrated, beyond doubt, that
Thomas Colston purchased the mansion of the
Creswicks, on the west side of Small Street, upon
the site of which the present Post Office stands.
It was in that house that Edward Colston resided,
if, indeed, at any time he ever did live
for more than a short period at one time in
Small Street.</p>

<p>When King Charles II, as Prince of Wales
accompanied his father to Bristol, and the Court
was located in Small Street on that very site,
probably he rode into, and about, the city in a
coach such as is given in the illustration at page
23, but there is no doubt, that in later days, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>the Battle of Worcester, he rode in on horseback
as a fugitive on his way to Abbotsleigh. His start
on the long journey from Boscobel mounted on the
Miller's pony, sans wig and sans royal garb, was
not altogether dignified, although the incident
here depicted is not wanting in pathetic interest,
as indicating the attachment to His Majesty of the
five faithful Penderel brothers.</p>

<p>In a report to the General Board of Health
on a preliminary enquiry into the sewerage,
drainage, and supply of water, and the sanitary
conditions of the inhabitants of the City and
County of Bristol in 1850, it was stated in a
petition from Messrs. H.J.J. Hinton &amp; Son,
Small Street, "There is a filthy lane, called
Leonard's Lane, near the bottom of Small
Street, and which leads round into Corn
Street. The state of it, in a general way, is
so bad as to be quite sufficient to produce
pestilence."</p>

<p>According to the report the Parish of St.
Werburgh contained 30 houses. Its population
in 1841 was 99, and its area was 300 square
yards. It had one burial ground, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE POST OFFICE TRUNK TELEPHONE SYSTEM AT BRISTOL.&mdash;THE
COLUMBIA STAMPING MACHINE.</p></div>


<p>The Post Office in Bristol commenced to
undertake telephone business in 1896. It
began with trunk telephone lines working to
Bath, Birmingham, Cardiff, Exeter, London,
Taunton, and Weston-super-Mare. At the outset
the conversations averaged about 170 daily.
In that same year the department took over
from the National Telephone Co., Cardiff, Gloucester,
Newport and Sharpness lines, and the conversations
soon increased to nearly 400 per day.
At the present time the department has from 1
to 5 (according to size of town) trunk lines to
Bath, Bradford-on-Avon, Birmingham, Cardiff,
Exeter, Gloucester, London, Lydney, Plymouth,
Newport, Sharpness, Southampton, Swansea,
Taunton, Tiverton, and Weston-super-Mare. An
increased number of wires has had marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
effect in diminishing the delays which at first
occurred through paucity of trunk lines, but
as the business is constantly increasing, the
department is still looked to for additional
lines. That the better accommodation is appreciated,
however, is indicated by the fact that
now the Bristol conversations average nearly
1,500 a day, or considerably over a quarter of
a million a year. On Sundays the trunk
telephones are available, but use is made of
them only to a small extent, there being only
about 150 conversations per Sunday. The total
number of trunk wire transactions throughout
the kingdom during the last year, according to
the Postmaster General's annual report, was
13,467,975, or, reckoning each transaction as
involving at least two spoken messages, a total
number of 26,935,950 (an increase of 16.3 per
cent. over that of the preceding year). The
revenue was &pound;325,525 (an increase of 18.4 per
cent.), and the average value of each transaction
was 5s. 8d. There is a silence box in the Public
Hall of the Bristol Post Office, from which conversations
can be held with all parts of the King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>dom,
with Belgium and France. Of course,
the greater number of trunk line telephone conversations
are held through the medium of the
National Telephone Company's local exchange,
but many important Bristol firms have contracted
with the Post Office for private telephone
wires in actual connection with the trunk line
system, independent altogether of the National
Co.'s exchange.</p>

<p>The intermingling of the National Telephone
business with that of the Post Office telegraphs
has had a further development in a system under
which subscribers to the National Company
telephone communications to the Post Office to
be sent on thence as telegrams over Post Office
telegraph wires. This privilege is taken advantage
of at Bristol to the extent of seven or eight
hundred messages weekly. The accession of
the trunk telephone business to the already
over-crowded office has had the effect of necessitating
the detachment of some part of the staff
from the Post Office headquarter premises in
Small Street, and the friendly relations between
the Telephone Company and the Post Office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
have been further strengthened by the Bristol
Post Office having taken certain rooms in the
headquarters of the National Telephone Co., and
located its Returned Letter Office therein.</p>

<p>Another new feature in Post Office development
is the use of Stamping Machines for the rapid
obliteration of the postage stamps and for the
impression of the day's date on letters. Quite
recently a machine of the kind has been introduced
into the Bristol Post Office. The machine, which
is of modern invention, goes by the name of
the "Columbia" Cancelling Machine, and is
manufactured by the Columbia Postal Supply
Company, of Silver Creek, New York, U.S.A. It
is said to be in use in many Post Offices in the
large towns of America and other countries. The
public will no doubt have noticed the new
cancelling marks on the postage stamps, as the
die and long horizontal lines are very striking.
The cancelling and date marking operation is
performed at the rate of 400 or 500 letters per
minute. The motor power of the machine is
electricity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE POST OFFICE BENEVOLENT SOCIETY: ITS ANNUAL
MEETING AT BRISTOL.&mdash;POST OFFICE SPORTS: TERRIBLE
MOTOR CYCLE ACCIDENT.&mdash;BRISTOL POST OFFICE IN DARKNESS.</p></div>


<p>The United Kingdom Postal and Telegraph
Service Benevolent Society held its Biennial
meeting at Bristol, in June, 1903, and a Banquet
was given by the Bristol Branch to the members
of the Conference.</p>

<p>Such a visit to Bristol occurs only once in
about 20 years, so it was regarded as an
event of no small importance in the local Post
Office community; and it is, perhaps, worthy
on that account of record in this publication,
which aims to be somewhat historical in
character. In the following account of the
Banquet there has been withdrawn the seasoning
of the "hear, hear," "laughter," "applause,"
"loud cheers," etc. The reader can add it to
his or her liking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The attendance at the Banquet was large, and
the guests closely filled the large central hall of the
Royal Hotel, College Green. The High Sheriff,
Mr. Weston Stevens, presided, and amongst those
present were the Lord Bishop of Bristol, Colonel
C.E.H. Hobhouse, M.P., Rev. A.N. Blatchford,
Messrs. J. McMurtrie, S. Humphries, R.C.
Tombs, I.S.O. (Postmaster and Surveyor of
Bristol), E. Bennett, J.T. Francombe, J. Asher,
J.C. Gilmore, L.J. Botting (the Bristol Central
Secretary), E.C. Taylor (the Chairman of Conference),
and many others.</p>

<p>The speeches were interesting as throwing a
light on the Post Office working, and on Post
Office benevolence.</p>

<p>When he received the invitation to attend
that dinner, Mr. Francombe said, he was at a loss
to know why he should be so honoured. He
thought that possibly some gentleman engaged
in the dead-letter office knew he was a member
of the Education Committee of Bristol, and
that he might give a hint to the rising generation
to write better, and so save him a great deal
of trouble. If that was the reason, he certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
would attend to it. Afterwards he said he knew
why it was; it was because Sir Francis Freeling
was born in Redcliff, where he (Mr. Francombe)
happened to be schoolmaster of the parish. Sir
Francis worked his way up to high rank in the
Postal Service, which was something to be proud
of. He hoped members of the Conference
would not go away from Bristol without visiting
Redcliff Church and seeing the slab to his
memory. But his duty was to propose the
toast of the Bishop and ministers of religion of
that ancient city. They did not know as much
about the Bishop as he should like them to know.
They in Bristol believed him to be physically,
mentally, and spiritually fit to be a leader in
the great city. He believed the work of a Bishop
was something like that of a policeman&mdash;not
altogether a happy one. His Lordship attended
many functions, gave a fillip to every one of
them, and all he said was reported and saved
up ready to be cast in his teeth sometimes. If
he were of a tender disposition he would say,
"I could weep my spirit from mine eyes." But
he was not one of that sort. His toast was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"Ministers of Religion." He thought it would
have been "Ministers of all denominations."
There was one denomination in Bristol that had
no ministers, and it went on wonderfully well.
He referred to the Society of Friends. He was
sure His Lordship would agree. They only
spoke when <i>the</i> spirit moved them, but a good
many spoke when <i>a</i> spirit moved them. Some
denominations were better without a minister,
and some ministers would be better without
denominations. In the city of Bristol there
was room enough for all, and they need not
spend time in attacking each other, but might
do the work God sent them to do. They had
one present that night&mdash;a broad-minded gentleman
who did his work like the Bishop, and
minded his business, and did not interfere with
other people&mdash;Mr. Blatchford.</p>

<p>They always listened in Bristol with special
pleasure to a speech from their friend Mr. Francombe,
the Lord Bishop said. He desired to
thank Mr. Francombe for the pleasant manner
in which he had spoken of him. The clergy and
ministers had looked about in the world for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
faces that were on the side of right, besides the
purely spiritual faces and spiritual work, and he
was always thankful to think a great deal of good
was done in the country by that great service
represented that evening. Their army of postmen
and employ&eacute;s of the Post Office were a very
great factor indeed in keeping steady a State
like their own. He always said the same of
certain other bodies, but of the postmen it seemed
to him they were so particularly careful about
their business, they learned of necessity to be so
sober and so well conducted, or they would lose
their place, that he looked upon them and the
railway men as two of the greatest civilising
influences they had among them, apart from
such work as Mr. Blatchford and he were called
upon officially to do. He desired to express,
on his own part, his extreme gratitude to those
gentlemen for another reason&mdash;the wonderful
accuracy with which they delivered the letters.
That gentleman who laughed might once in his
life have missed a letter addressed to him, but
it did not happen to the Bishop. In the five
and a half years he had been in Bristol, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
large correspondence, he was not conscious of
having lost one single letter. He should have
been exceedingly glad if a good many had been
lost. It so happened he gave the Post Office
a good deal of trouble. He lived at a place
called the Palace. Now Henry VIII. created
a bishop's residence in Bristol, a palace, and it
was supposed that a palace must mean something
royal. The real fact was, the name was
derived not from a king's palace but from that
of a shepherd&mdash;a most suitable thing for a bishop.
Henry VIII., besides creating his residence a
palace, created Bristol a city in the same document.
The name palace gave a certain amount
of trouble, because there were palaces in some
cities where other things than bishops were
sold. There was a palace where a certain
innocuous drink was sold, and letters sometimes
went there. There was also a most delightful
place of entertainment called the People's
Palace in Bristol, and letters sometimes went
there. When grave clergymen from a distance
came to stay at his house they were occasionally
driven up to the doors of the People's Palace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and the cabmen expected that they were going
to purchase tickets for the entertainment. A
letter came to Bristol addressed "March 25th,
Bristol." The Postmaster was puzzled at first.
Then it occurred to him that the assizes were
on, and Justice Day was the judge, and that
his wife was Lady Day. He should like to tell
them one thing more from history. Admirable
as the Post Office was now, a little more than
1,200 years ago, a letter was sent to his predecessor,
St. Aldhelm, from Ireland. The only
address given was from an anonymous Scot.
The letter said, "You have a book which
it is only the business of a fortnight to read;
I beg you to send it to me." That was all.
He did not name the book. The Post Office in
those days was so marvellous a thing that, as far
as they knew, Aldhelm just took the book, put it
in the post, addressed to an anonymous Scot,
and he supposed it found its way to him in
Ireland. He did not think they could beat that
to-day. Few people knew how much the country
was saved in taxation by people who had a large
correspondence. Their letters were the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
agreeable and easy way of paying their taxes.
When they came to see the Budget analysed it
was surprising what a large amount of taxation
was paid in this innocent way. He could not
see how it was done. It seemed that the work
for which a penny was charged must cost at least
a penny. He could only understand it on the
principle of the old Irish lady who lost on every
single apple she sold, but, by the blessing of
God, sold so many that she got a good living
out of it.</p>

<p>He was not surprised, the Rev. A.N. Blatchford
said, that the toast should be so heartily
received in a city known as the city of churches.
The Church had thrown herself from ancient
time into the cause of the people; progress
and religion had been indissolubly linked
together.</p>

<p>In proposing the toast "The Postal and Telegraph
Service," Mr. Sidney Humphries, J.P., present
President of the Chamber of Commerce, said that
when he was asked to propose the next toast on
the list, his thoughts naturally turned to the reason
for his being put forward to do this duty, and
the only explanation that had occurred to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
was that having had the hardihood to be one
of a deputation to the Postmaster-General quite
recently, on the question of their local postal
service, those who had had the arrangement of
this function, Mikado like, had lured him to
his punishment; but still, being in for it, many
interesting thoughts had arisen. The first, as
to the foresight of that Worcestershire schoolmaster,
Rowland Hill, who, feeling the pinch
of expense, made an agreement with his sweetheart
to only write once a fortnight, the rates
of postage in his early days varying from 2d. to
1s. in accordance with the distance at which
they were separated. Fortunately, his thoughts
were directed to the penny postage for all distances
within the United Kingdom, and although
many spoke of him as an over-sanguine dreamer,
still events had proved his wisdom, and to-day
they had a postal service that dealt with over
3,832 million letters, postcards, and papers per
annum, giving 91 per head of the population,
as against 940 millions 33 years ago, with the
comparatively small number of 30 per head
then. Whilst speaking of the enormous growth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the postal business, they must not lose sight
of the wonderful growth of both the telegraph
and Savings Bank business. The former, since
it was taken over by Government in 1870, had
more than justified that step, for in the following
year&mdash;1871&mdash;the number of telegrams sent was
10 millions, whilst last year the number was well
over 92 million messages. Then as regards the
Savings Bank, they could flatter themselves as
to the proof it furnished of the increased wealth
of the country, for whilst the total Savings Bank
capital in 1869 was 13&frac12; millions, in 1901 it stood
at over 140 millions. But whilst all this progress
had been made, many helpful suggestions
had been made by men of moderate position.
Take, for instance, a time so long ago as 1784:
the credit of first suggesting the mail coach
was made by a Mr. Palmer, who was then the
manager of the theatre in their neighbouring
city of Bath. This was a great improvement
as to speed and safety of delivery when compared
with the old postboy; but think of the mail
coach when compared with the mail trains that
covered now over three millions of miles per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
annum. But with all this progress there had
been many other changes. Think of the notice
that was issued to all postal employ&eacute;s in 1832,
that none were to vote or advise electors how
to vote. This was very different to running
a candidate on postal lines, as was to take place
at the next election at York. And in considering
what for a better term he might call the commercial
side of the question, there were instances
that ought not to be overlooked in great numbers
of devotion to duty&mdash;for example, take
that of the Scotch mail carrier, who, feeling
himself overcome by the gale and snow, hung
his mail-bag on a tree so that the letters should
not be lost, even if his life were sacrificed. Then
this postal system seemed to develop a special
shrewdness. One local case had been mentioned
by the Bishop as having recently occurred,
and there was another in which a pictorial
address of Daniel in the lion's den found its
rightful owner, who had become talked about
by his visit to a menagerie just before. But in
case they should all think that at last perfection
had been reached, there was another circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>stance
that he could relate from his own personal
experience. Wanting to send a parcel to Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, he foolishly sent it to his
private address, at 40, Portman Square, instead
of his official residence, he being Chancellor of
Exchequer at the time, and judge of his own
astonishment when he received an official
announcement, "Cannot be delivered owing to
address being unknown." But this did not
tell against their Bristol friends, a body of men,
he ventured to say, who for smartness and
anxiety at all times to meet the various calls
made upon them could not be surpassed, and
therefore he called upon them all to drink
heartily the toast of the Postal and Telegraph
Service, coupling with it the name of their local
Postmaster and Surveyor, who was always to
the fore in anything that would help forward
Bristol or Bristol interests.</p>

</div>

<p>In replying, the Postmaster thanked them
all for the cordial reception of the toast of the
Postal and Telegraph Services, and especially Mr.
Humphries, the proposer, for the kind and considerate
and genial way in which he had alluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to his department. In the first place, he wished
to extend to the delegates assembled there&mdash;and
they came from all parts of the United Kingdom,
North, South, East, and West&mdash;the right hand
of good comradeship. Welcome, delegates to
Bristol, thrice welcome, he said. He supposed,
in response to this important toast, they would
expect that he should say something of the postal
system. The Lord Bishop had taken them back
some hundreds of years&mdash;1200 years back, when
Bishop Aldhelm wrote a letter. He must go a
little further back than that. His friend, Mr.
Humphries, found a parallel in Holy Scripture&mdash;Daniel
in the lion's den. He found in Holy
Writ, the only book of ancient date he had to refer
to, that posts and letters were of respectable
antiquity. They would find recorded in Kings
II. this passage in connection with the account
of that pathetic incident of the little Israelitish
maiden suggesting the means whereby Naaman
might be cured&mdash;"Go to," said the King of Syria,
"I will send a letter to the King of Israel." In
the wisdom of Solomon were the words, "My
days are like a shadow that passeth away, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
like the post that hasteth by." So they saw in
those ancient days it was all hurry for the postman.
He would skip a few thousand years and
come to 1496. It was recorded that the means
of communication in this country were almost
non-existent, and news was carried to and
fro by means of travelling merchants, pedlars,
and pilgrims. In 1637 letter posts were established
by Charles I. King Charles stopped
in the building that stood on the site of their
local St. Martin's-le-Grand, but little could he
have thought that the day would come when
it would be possible for a man to stand on
that spot and speak to a friend and recognise
his voice, as far away as Wexford. Sir
Francis Freeling had been named. He became
secretary to the Post Office. He served in the
Bristol office two or three years before being
translated to London to become the associate of
Palmer, of mail-coach renown. The old city of
Bristol had been under a cloud. In the year
1793 they had only one postman, and two or
three years later two. Now they had 500. In
the last 60 years the letters posted and delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in Bristol increased from 66 millions to 134 millions
in the year. This was an enormous increase,
and showed that Bristol was going to forge ahead
again. It made them glad that the old city had
once again aroused herself. The Post Office had
become a giant in the kingdom, but it exercised
its power as a kindly giant. They heard the
demand for all sorts of reforms, but they felt
that Mr. Austen Chamberlain was equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"The Postal and Telegraph Benevolent Society"
was submitted by Lieut.-Colonel Hobhouse, M.P.,
who said he was not sure that before long they
would not have to add to their service, and include
the telephonic operators as well. He noticed they
depended in their work, and for the relief which
they gave to their members, entirely upon the
donations of their own members. That was
satisfactory, not only to them, but to him as a
Member of Parliament, because Members of
Parliament seldom came to gatherings of that
sort without being requested to make some contribution,
direct or indirect, to the funds of the
Society, so good as to give them a dinner. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
understood the provision of the Society was
in addition to the official pension of the Post
Office.</p>

<p>In reply, Mr. Botting said they must all feel
very much flattered by the terms in which Colonel
Hobhouse had referred to their Society. He felt
that they might almost suggest to the Government
that the questions of old age pensions and the
financial position of friendly societies might be
handed over to them to deal with. He might
remind them of a remark made at the meeting,
although having an M.P. present, perhaps he
should not refer to it, that their Society got
through more work in a day than the House of
Commons did in a month. He considered they
had at their Conference got through a good day's
work. He would not give a long string of
statistics, but he must mention that the Society
had a membership of 19,600, had been in existence
nearly 28 years, and during that time had paid
to the nominees of deceased members just upon
&pound;300,000, made up chiefly of penny contributions.
Such payments had been in many cases all that
had stood between the widows and orphans and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
absolute destitution. In considering this, they
must not forget his friend beside him, whose
fertile brain had created the Society. They
must all regret to learn of Mr. Asher's retirement
from the Service through ill-health, and they
would all hope that the release from official work
would prove beneficial to him. He (Mr. Botting)
hoped that so long as the Society existed the name
of Mr. Asher would never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Asher was received very heartily. He
said the proposal that such a society should be
formed was regarded as the day dream of a
sanguine mind, but it was something to reflect
upon, the immense amount of good that had been
done in the course of years. More practical help
he could not imagine rendering to the fellows in
the Service. He trusted that the work of that
day's Conference might re-echo and redound to
the credit of the Bristol meeting, and he desired,
in thanking their Bristol friends, to couple with
them the names of Mr. E.C. Taylor and the
Reception Committee.</p>

<p>In proposing "The City and County of Bristol,"
Mr. Edward Bennett said that he had attended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
a great number of these banquets, and had had
on several occasions to propose the toast of the
particular town which was for the moment entertaining
the Society. For this reason he was,
perhaps, looked upon as a special pleader, and when
he was praising a provincial city his tongue was
thought to be in his cheek, and London was written
on his heart. When Stella was told that Dean
Swift had composed a poem, not in honour of her,
but of Vanessa, she replied, with exquisite feminine
amenity, that it was well known that the Dean
could be eloquent over a broomstick. If he that
night extolled Bristol above her other rivals, it
would be said of him that he was a verbose individual,
who had called in past years Leeds a
beautiful and inspiring city, Liverpool a rising
seaport, and Glasgow a town where urbanity and
sweet reasonableness prevailed. It might be
remembered of him that he had praised the
Birmingham man for his childlike humility, and
the Edinburgh man for his excessive modesty.
It was his first visit to Bristol, and it was presumption
on his part to speak on the subject at all.
Silence was the better part when a man was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
situated as he was. There were some exquisite
lines he learnt as a child which conveyed a deep
moral lesson to all day trippers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
There was a young lady of Sweden<br />
She went by the slow train to Weedon,<br />
When she arrived at Weedon Station she made no observation,<br />
But returned by the slow train to Sweden.<br />
</div>

<p>That was what he ought to have done. His
heart went out to that young lady, and he often
had pondered whether it was disgust, astonishment,
or admiration which had inspired her
silence. There was a special reason why Civil
Servants should be drawn to Bristol. Doubtless
even the Bristol Chamber of Commerce was
acquainted with the process known as "passing
over"&mdash;many persons in that room had perhaps
undergone the operation&mdash;and those who read the
history of Bristol felt a pull at their heart strings
when they realised the fact that she also had been
"passed over" by younger and more pushful
rivals. But the capable Civil Servant never
admitted the justice of being passed over. In
many instances he established his case, and he
did not rest satisfied until he had retrieved his
position, and in time caught up his quondam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
rivals. That, he took it, was the position of
Bristol at the present time. She had relied too
much on her ancient name, and had allowed
mushroom places like Liverpool and Manchester
to steal a march on her. She was coming to the
front again; she had a glorious past, but she was
going to have a brilliant future. He coupled with
the toast the name of the High Sheriff. If he
knew any evil of the High Sheriff he would not
mention it that evening. He had still 24 hours
to spend in Bristol, and a man could do a lot of
evil as well as good in that time.</p>

<p>The High Sheriff made a short speech in reply
to the toast.</p>

<p>Other good speeches followed.</p>

<p>The Post Office Cycling and Athletic Clubs
have for some years past been in the habit of
holding Sports at the County Ground in Bristol.
These annual sports, having been held on Saturday
afternoons, have usually been successful, and
have attracted large crowds. In 1903, the sports,
held on the 23rd May, attracted no fewer than
nine thousand persons, owing to the unusual
feature of motor cycle races having been arranged
as a novelty&mdash;motor cycle racing not having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
been carried on in Bristol before. There were
several competitors, and London as well as local
men, took part in the motor cycle races.
Unfortunately, the track, which had been made
some sixteen years previously for ordinary cycle
competitions, was not suitable for motor racing
at great speed. In one of the heats Bailey, of
Bristol, was leading Barnes, of London, a noted
motor cyclist, and through some mishap at or
soon after the moment of Barnes getting past
Bailey, his machine having run rather wide on
the track, got out of his command, and dashed
into the fringe of sightseers who were lying on
the bank to get the best point of view. The
result was a fearful carnage, and ten or eleven
people were carried away insensible and much
injured. In the end, three poor boys died in the
Hospital, and fortunately the seven or eight other
people who were injured, slowly recovered from
their concussions and contusions. At the inquest,
the verdict was "Accidental Death."</p>

<p>On the 23rd December, 1903, shortly after
five o'clock p.m., the civic supply of electricity
in Bristol failed, and shops, business premises,
and houses depending upon it for light, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
plunged into darkness in all parts of the city.
This was soon known to be due to a fire having
broken out at Temple Back Generating Station,
and the glare in the sky suggested that the outbreak
had reached serious proportions. The
Bristol Post Office has a full installation of electric
light; and the failure could not have occurred
at a more inconvenient time, as the pressure
incidental to Christmas was being experienced.
Fortunately, not only for the Post Office, but
also for the general public, the large staff engaged
in the interior of the building was able to cope
with the extensive work before them practically
without interruption, as throughout the whole of
the department, gas is still laid on, and, beyond
the shifting of one or two desks to within reasonable
distance of gas jets, no inconvenience was
caused after the burners and fittings&mdash;somewhat
out of order through non-usage&mdash;were put to
rights. The public hall, however, suffered most,
as, when thus robbed of the electric light at one
of the busiest periods of the evening, only scattered
gas jets were available, and they had to be supplemented
by lighted candles set at intervals around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the semi-circular counter. Some of the candles
were in primitive holders, stuck in blocks of wood,
and plugged firmly with nails; others were even
without these supports. The Counter Officers
had, therefore, to work under difficulties; but
they got through their manifold duties expeditiously.
The greatest inconvenience was occasioned
at St. James's Parish Hall, which was
being temporarily used as a Post Office. Here,
there was no gas service available, and when the
electric lights "gave out," the staff had to scurry
hither and thither to get illuminants, which took
the form of postmen's lamps, table lamps, candles
in improvised holders, and such few hurricane
lamps as were procurable at the shops, in the
general run on them. The electric light was
fully restored in the evening of the next day.
This fire recalls an occasion when at St. Martin's-le-Grand,
the gas supply failed, and the largest
Post Office business of the world was placed at a
standstill. The officials, however, were equal to
the emergency, and cartloads of candles were
quickly obtained. The staff of carpenters employed
on the building improvised receptacles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and the postal work was proceeded with, candles
as they burnt out being replaced by men told off
for the purpose. Some time afterwards, it was
suggested that the stock of candles left over
should be disposed of, but it was then found that
these had been devoured by the innumerable
rats which infest the old building.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>QUAINT ADDRESSES AND THE DEAN'S PECULIAR SIGNATURE.&mdash;AMUSING
INCIDENTS AND THE POSTMAN'S KNOCK.&mdash;HUMOROUS APPLICATIONS.</p></div>


<p>The members of the Bristol Post Office Staff
have to display no little perspicacity in
elucidating quaint addresses on letters going
through the post. To Postman Wade must go
the credit of having correctly surmised that the
letter addressed simply "25th March, Clifton," to
which allusion has already been made, was intended
for Lady Day, the wife of the Judge of Assize,
Mr. Justice Day, then staying in Clifton. A letter
addressed to "W.D. &amp; H.O.", without street
or town being named, came from a distant county,
and was delivered to the firm of Messrs. W.D. &amp;
H.O. Wills &amp; Co., in Bristol, for whom it was
found to be intended.</p>

<p>The pictorial illustrations herewith demonstrate
two instances of letters correctly delivered by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
post office officials after the address had been
deciphered by their <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bristol Royal Mail</i> particulars were given
of the peculiar way in which correspondents
addressed their envelopes to the Post Office,
Bristol. Since that publication was issued, other
peculiar instances have occurred. The following
are cases of the kind, viz.:&mdash;The Head Postmaster
(Master's Parlour). The Honourable The Postmaster.
Postmaster Number 58 (in answer to
query on Form "Postmasters No. 58"). Master,
General Post Office, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Dean of Bristol in the preface of his very
interesting book "Odds and Ends," writes of the
many liberties people take with his surname in
their communications, and says that none of their
imaginary names are so pleasing to him as his own
proper name of Pigou. That his correspondents
are not altogether to be blamed may be gathered
from the fact that the Dean, in an official letter to
the Bristol Post Office, signed his name thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 10%;">
<img src="images/signature.jpg" width="100%" alt="Signature" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>The signature was submitted to 22 officers who
decipher the badly addressed letters at the
"Blind" Division, at "Head Quarters," in the
General Post Office, London, and their interpretations
were as follows, viz.:&mdash;J. Rogers, J. Egan,
Ryan, J. Lyon, Roper, J. or T. Rogers, J. Rogers,
J. Logan, J. Lyon, J. Logan, J. Pogon, T. Lyon,
J. Rogers, J. Goson, J. Rogers, J. Eason, T.
Egan, J. Goyfer, J.G. Offin, J. Lyons, J. Pyon,
J. Pijou.</p>

<img src="images/illus-053b.jpg" width="100%" alt="QUAINT ADDRESS." title="" />
<span class="caption">QUAINT ADDRESS.</span>
</div>

<p>It is only fair to the "Blind Writers" to say,
that the address heading of the Dean's letter was
withdrawn before the signature was submitted to
them. With that clue they would readily have
been able to find out the writer's correct name
from their books of reference, so that the Dean is
not likely to suffer delay of his letters in the
Returned Letter Office through peculiarity of
signature.</p>

<p>During a recent Christmas Season a parcel,
containing a lb. roll of butter was received, without
address, in the returned Letter Office, Bristol,
from a Devonshire town. As the parcel could
not be returned to the sender within such a time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
as the contents remained good, the butter was
sold for cooking purposes. When placed upon
the kitchen table, the edge of a yellow coin was
observed to be slightly protruding from the roll.
The coin turned out to be a sovereign, and
search was made to ascertain whether any more
money had been so strangely hidden, but only
the &pound;1 was found. The money was at once
forwarded to the proper Post Office authorities,
and subsequently returned to the sender, but
would-be imitators are warned that such practices
are strongly deprecated by the Post Office
Department as tending to lead to dishonesty.</p>

<p>The Corporation of Bristol erected electric light
ventilators in different parts of the city. At a
distance, possibly, these ventilators appear, to
the short-sighted, to be Post Office pillar boxes,
as they are iron boxes placed on the pavement
near the kerbstones. They differ in many
respects from the familiar Post Office boxes, for,
instead of being round, they are square; they are
painted of a different colour, and are only about
two feet high. They are without indicators,
notice plates, and doors. There is a slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
raised top for the passage of air. Through this
opening of one of the boxes letters have been
recently posted by three separate persons. Such
carelessness is astonishing.</p>

<p>The Electric Lighting Authorities, to prevent
further mishaps of the kind, arranged to have
the apertures closed by means of perforated zinc.</p>

<p>Even in these days of primary and secondary
education, people have still a very elementary
knowledge of matters relating to the Postal and
Telegraph Services, in which everyone is vitally
concerned. Recently, an intelligent servant who
had received a Board School education was sent
with a telegram to a Telegraph Office, and told to
pay for a reply. Having paid for the reply, she
expected to get one there and then, and it was
only with very great reluctance that she was
induced to leave the Telegraph Office without a
reply to convey back to the person who entrusted
her with the commission.</p>

<p>A complainant to the Post Office expressed himself
thus:&mdash;"Jan. 1st, 1904. Dear Sir,&mdash;Your
Postman on 28th by the First post In the morning,
With a newspaper,) My Sister Was at the back at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>

us to pay for a Nother Why dont him coum
as A Man and pay for one Sir. I. Must conclued
with Best regurds to you, Yours Truley, F.H.G."</p>

<p>Travellers from North and East to the West
of England and <i>vice versa</i> are aware that the
Bristol Joint Great Western and Midland station
is a busy railway centre. At a recent Christmas
season, there was much remark on the part of
the railway passengers with respect to the platforms
being blocked up with barrows containing
mails and the large stack of parcel baskets to be
met with at every point. Said one traveller,
"It's all blooming Post Office on the platform
and no room for travellers to get about." Said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
another, "The late arrival of the train was all
due to that 'parcel post.'"</p>

<p>A sub-postmaster in the Bristol district was
called to account for employing on the delivery
of letters a boy of fourteen years of age, instead
of a person of sixteen years of age or upwards.
He nominated another person, who, he stated,
was of proper age, being over 16 years old. A
year or two afterwards a question of discipline
arose about this individual, and it then transpired
that he was 68 years of age&mdash;rather too old
to commence life in His Majesty's Service!</p>

<p>The phrase "guileless Ministers" in the speech
of a former Prime Minister on the fiscal question
(1903) became in course of telegraphing "guileless
monsters," and so reached the Bristol press.
Fortunately, the newspaper proof readers were
wide awake, and the error was corrected in time.</p>

<p>Correspondents have a peculiar idea of the
functions devolving on a postmaster, as the
following letters will indicate, viz.:&mdash;</p>


<p>"Brighton, March 13th, 1904. To the Postmaster;
Sir,&mdash;Would you have pleased to try and
get me a small tin of very light coloured dry snuff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
(I think it is called Lundifoot) from one of the
leading tobacconists in Bristol. If you will
let me know the amount thereof I will send you
the money for the same before you send it. I
am, Yours, etc., J.S.A.</p>

<p>"Scarborough, 6th August, 1904; Sir,&mdash;Would
you please be good enough to let me know
by return, whether the nightingale is in song
in Clifton Woods at the present time. Thanking
you in anticipation, and apologising for troubling
you. Believe me, Yours truly, (Sd.) (Mrs.) F.F."</p>

<p>"Cardiff, April 29th, 1902. Sir,&mdash;May I ask
you the favour to hand over the enclosed Bristol
Blister to the chemist who sells it in your town,
when some person of your office passes the shop.
I received considerable benefit from the blister.
I shall be very much obliged to you and the
chemist if he will be so good to let me know how
he sells them. I am, Yours truly, (Sd.) T.B."</p>

<p>Not only are the articles themselves of a
diversified character that pass through the parcel
post, but the mode of packing often produces
a certain amount of dubiousness in the minds
of the Parcel Department officials as to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
is really the "Right side up," and how to handle
the packages. The sender of a rabbit, however;
left no doubt on the matter, as he had arranged
poor defunct "Bunny" in such a way that its
head was securely tied between its hind legs,
and the latter formed a convenient handle, the
front legs being tucked under the neck, and
the rabbit presenting the appearance of a ball.
Another incident was of rather an amusing
character. The "tie-on" labels had become
detached from two packages which reached
Bristol. A label which properly belonged to
a bottle of cough medicine was attached in the
Returned Letter Office to an old slipper, and
the label proper to the medicine was delivered
without packet or other attachment to the shoemaker
for whom the slipper was intended.
Fortunately, upon inquiry being made by the
interested parties, the medicine and slipper were
delivered to the rightful addressees.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold Morley, during his term

Bristol Incorporated Chamber of Commerce

Arnold Morley, M.P., Her Majesty's Postmaster

Chamber of Commerce and Shipping
are glad to embrace the opportunity afforded
by your visit to this city of expressing their
high appreciation of the services rendered to
the state in general and to the commercial com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>munity
in particular by the energy and enterprise
displayed in your administration of the
Postal and Telegraphic Departments of the
public service. We recognise that in matters
such as are ranged under your control there can
be no finality, and that however excellent our
present Postal and Telegraphic arrangements
may appear, your Departments must be quick
to discern the arrival of fresh needs such as our
rapidly developing civilization must constantly
bring. We rejoice in the abundant evidence
that you have thoroughly appreciated the absolute
necessity for continual advance and adaptation,
and that you are labouring with such zeal to
keep the complicated machinery of the General
Post Office up to date and equal to the immense
and ever increasing strain it has to bear, whilst
the Council think it only right to acknowledge
the marked and unvarying urbanity with which,
at all times, you and your officials receive and
discuss any suggestions for the improvement of
the services, emanating from Chambers of Commerce
and other sources. In conclusion, the
Council recognise in your person the son of a late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
highly-esteemed Parliamentary Representative of
the city of Bristol, Mr. Samuel Morley, who for

of this Chamber and of the Association
of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom;
and the Council take this occasion to
tender you their sincere congratulations on the
high position you have attained in the councils
and government of this great Empire. We
remain, Sir, Your obedient servants, (Sd.) George
H. Perrin, President; E. Burrow Hill, Mark
Whitwill, Vice-Presidents; H.J. Spear, Secretary.
Bristol, 1st Nov., 1894."</p>

<p>The Marquis of Londonderry, when Postmaster-General,
was the chief guest at the annual
banquet of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce,
held at the Royal Hotel, Bristol, under the
presidency of Mr. T.T. Lindrea, on the 24th
April, 1901. Among those present were Earl
Waldegrave, Sir Herbert Ashman, J.P., Sir
Frederick Wills, M.P., Judge Austin, J.P., Mr.
C.E. Hobhouse, M.P., Mr. Lewis Fry, the Lord
Mayor (Mr. Colthurst Godwin), the High Sheriff
(Mr. E.B. James), etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>In responding to the toast of "His Majesty's
Ministers," Lord Londonderry alluded to the
great growth that had taken place in the population,
trade, and prosperity of Bristol during the
late Queen's reign. Last February, he said,
in eighteen days, the amount paid on goods
taken out of Bond reached &pound;487,000. Of this
sum, no less than &pound;430,000 was paid in the last
eight days, and of this &pound;370,000 came from a
single firm for withdrawals of tobacco from
Bond. This included the enormous single
cheque paid by that firm one day for a quarter
of a million&mdash;the largest single cheque ever
known at His Majesty's Customs at Bristol.
He also congratulated Bristol on the great
development to her trade that must come through
the inauguration in February last of the new
service to the West Indies. This, he was sure,
would do much not only to strengthen the ties
that bound this country to the West Indian
Colonies, but also to restore to Bristol some
measure of that position she had once enjoyed
in the trade of the United Kingdom. He was
rather glad his good friend the Chancellor of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Exchequer was not there that night, for if he
heard how much was spent in benefiting those
who relied on the Post Office, and how little
they handed over to the national exchequer, he
would not be inclined to meet him when he
suggested certain postal reforms, as he intended
to do next year. He hoped they would invite
him to meet Sir Michael in Bristol, for he might
then be inclined to grant him (the speaker) any
request he might make. He wanted them to
recognise that the Postmaster-General's good
intentions, and they were many, were controlled
by Parliamentary and statutory exigencies. He
had also been asked to improve their rates on
foreign letters and parcels, as well as to cheapen
the delivery of letters and parcels from abroad;
but it was entirely forgotten that he had
to reckon with foreign Powers. A Postal
Reformer had declared, in a letter, that it was
possible to create an ideal Post Office. He
wished he could accede to every one of his requests,
but he had to consider Parliament;
he was not master himself. He thought that
if they were to meet the requirements of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
public as they were anxious to do, they must
proceed in the course in which they were moving
at present&mdash;with steadiness and sureness, and
not promise things which it was impossible to
fulfil.</p>

<p>The Ex-Postmaster of the House of Commons,
Mr. E.W. Pike, is a Somersetshire man; he
was born at Ilchester, and his grandfather was
the last Governor of the Gaol of that town.
When Mr. Pike was ten years of age, his father
received an appointment under the act constituting
the new County Court system, and
removed to Temple Cloud in the Bristol district.
The family afterwards moved to the adjacent
village of Clutton, and Mr. Pike went there with
the other members.</p>

<p>Mr. Pike remembers that the Post Office at
Temple Cloud was held by Mrs. Carter, and
after her death John Spear had the office. Mr.
Pike's active service in the Post Office terminated
on Wednesday, the 14th September, 1903.
His experience in the Post Office was unique,
and no wonder that he felt proud on retiring,
that during a service of nearly 46 years he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
given full satisfaction to his superiors in the
Post Office, and to have had the approbation of
the Members of the House of Commons specially
expressed to him by the Prime Minister, Mr.
A.J. Balfour.</p>

<p>There was no small stir at the public counter of
the Bristol Post Office on the first day of January,
1902, the day of issue of the new 1/2d., 1d., 2&frac12;d.,
and 6d. postage stamps, bearing the medallion
portrait of King Edward the VIIth. People
were very anxious to become possessed of specimens,
and many of the stamps sold were evidently
intended to adorn collector's books. The sales
on the 1st January, 1902, were:&mdash;1/2d., &pound;175; 1d.,
&pound;500; 2&frac12;d., &pound;27 10s.; 6d., &pound;66 9s., and were
slightly in excess of the average. The general
public demanded the new kind almost without
exception, but firms took old stamps to the
extent of 10 per cent. of the whole lot supplied.</p>

<p>The Staff of the Bristol Post Office sent an
illuminated address to the King for His Majesty's
Coronation Day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pattie E. Varnam-Coggan, a lady who
at the time was Postmistress of Chipping Sod<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>bury
composed the following hymn in connection
with the event.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The staff also made elaborate arrangements
to take an active part in the grand procession
which had been organized at Bristol to celebrate
the Coronation, but, alas, the procession had
to be postponed in consequence of the King's
sudden illness on the 24th June, and finally
was abandoned altogether. The Post Office
section, which was to have been honoured
with first place in the procession, was designed
to give the Bristol public some idea of the
working of this most useful branch of the
public service. The section was to have been
arranged as follows:&mdash;Telegraph Messengers'
Drum and Fife Band. Company of Telegraph
Messengers, with Carbines. Telegraph Messengers'
Cycle Corps. Company of Postmen. Mail
Carrier Tricycle. Country Mail Cart&mdash;present
day. Town Mail Van&mdash;present day. London to
Bristol Royal Mail Coach of 100 years since, with
Coachman and Guard in Royal livery of the
Period. Guard carrying an ancient Mail Guard's
blunderbuss, borrowed from the armoury of Mr.

<p>The following acknowledgment of the Address
was received on the King's recovery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Home Office, Whitehall, 5 Sept., 1902. Sir,&mdash;I

<p>The address to His Majesty is here reproduced,
and as the sentiments contained in it represent
the writer's wishes for King and Queen, it may,
perhaps, fittingly close the chapters of "The
King's Post."</p>
